      "question": "We are designing S20: Presentation & Readability for our WBP (Workback Plan) evaluation framework.\n\nOur GOAL for S20 is NOT just about aesthetics or formatting compliance. The deeper purpose is:\n\n**User Experience & First Impression**: When a user sees a WBP for the FIRST TIME, they should:\n1. INSTANTLY RECOGNIZE what it is (a workback plan)\n2. IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND how to interact with it\n3. FEEL drawn to use it (emotional engagement through good design)\n\nForm and style are 'emotional factors' that create user affinity and trust in a product.\n\n**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: All assertions must be OBJECTIVELY TESTABLE - easy to check programmatically or by a human evaluator with clear pass/fail criteria. Avoid subjective judgments.\n\nCurrent proposed assertions:\n1. Format Enforcement: Structured timetable with Task, Owner, Deadline, Status columns\n2. Goal Statement Presence: Clear mission statement at the start\n3. Conciseness & Scannability: Brief, clear task descriptions\n4. Form & Style Consistency: Uniform formatting and date styles\n5. Readability & Coherence: Logical sequencing and grouping\n\nPlease:\n\n1. CRITIQUE each assertion for TESTABILITY - can it be objectively evaluated? Score each 1-5 for testability.\n\n2. REVISE assertions to be more testable while still capturing UX goals. For each, provide:\n   - The assertion statement\n   - Specific pass/fail criteria\n   - How to test it (automated or manual)\n\n3. Suggest NEW assertions that are both UX-focused AND easily testable.\n\n4. Should we rename S20 to better reflect this UX goal?\n\n5. Provide concrete GOOD vs POOR examples for each final assertion.\n\nFocus on making assertions that are ACTIONABLE and MEASURABLE, not vague or subjective.",
      "answer": "Great challenge! Let’s tackle this systematically.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Critique Current Assertions for TESTABILITY**\n\n| # | Assertion | Testability Score (1–5) | Why |\n|---|-----------|---------------------------|-----|\n| 1 | **Format Enforcement: Structured timetable with Task, Owner, Deadline, Status columns** | **5** | Very testable: check for required columns and structure. |\n| 2 | **Goal Statement Presence: Clear mission statement at the start** | **3** | Presence of a statement is testable, but “clear” is subjective. Need to define what counts as a goal statement (e.g., keyword presence, position). |\n| 3 | **Conciseness & Scannability: Brief, clear task descriptions** | **2** | “Brief” and “clear” are subjective. Could define max word count per task, but clarity is hard to measure objectively. |\n| 4 | **Form & Style Consistency: Uniform formatting and date styles** | **4** | Date format consistency is testable. Font/heading consistency is harder but possible with structured templates. |\n| 5 | **Readability & Coherence: Logical sequencing and grouping** | **2** | “Logical” is subjective. Could test if tasks are sorted by date or grouped by phase, but requires clear rules. |\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Revise Assertions to Be More Testable**\n\n### **Final Assertions for S20**\n\n---\n\n### **Assertion 1: Required Columns Present**\n- **Statement:** The WBP must include a structured table with columns: `Task`, `Owner`, `Deadline`, `Status`.\n- **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All four columns exist with headers spelled correctly.\n- **How to Test:**  \n  - **Automated:** Parse table headers and check for exact matches.\n  - **Manual:** Visual scan for column names.\n- **GOOD Example:**  \n  | Task | Owner | Deadline | Status |  \n  |------|-------|----------|--------|  \n  | Draft report | Alice | 2024-07-15 | In Progress |\n- **POOR Example:**  \n  | Activity | Person | Due Date | Progress |\n\n---\n\n### **Assertion 2: Goal Statement Exists at the Top**\n- **Statement:** A goal or mission statement must appear within the first 3 lines of the WBP.\n- **Pass/Fail Criteria:** A text block labeled “Goal” or “Objective” appears before the task table.\n- **How to Test:**  \n  - **Automated:** Search for keywords (`Goal`, `Objective`, `Purpose`) in first 3 lines.\n  - **Manual:** Check top section for labeled goal.\n- **GOOD Example:**  \n  **Goal:** Deliver marketing campaign assets by Aug 30 to support product launch.\n- **POOR Example:**  \n  (No goal stated, jumps straight to tasks.)\n\n---\n\n### **Assertion 3: Task Description Length**\n- **Statement:** Each task description must be ≤ 12 words.\n- **Pass/Fail Criteria:** No task description exceeds 12 words.\n- **How to Test:**  \n  - **Automated:** Count words in `Task` column.\n  - **Manual:** Quick scan for long sentences.\n- **GOOD Example:**  \n  “Create initial wireframes for homepage.”\n- **POOR Example:**  \n  “Create initial wireframes for homepage including all responsive breakpoints and accessibility adjustments.”\n\n---\n\n### **Assertion 4: Consistent Date Format**\n- **Statement:** All deadlines must use the same date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n- **Pass/Fail Criteria:** Every entry in `Deadline` column matches regex `\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}`.\n- **How to Test:**  \n  - **Automated:** Regex check.\n  - **Manual:** Scan for uniform date style.\n- **GOOD Example:**  \n  2024-07-15\n- **POOR Example:**  \n  07/15/24 or July 15th, 2024\n\n---\n\n### **Assertion 5: Chronological Order**\n- **Statement:** Tasks must be sorted by `Deadline` in ascending order.\n- **Pass/Fail Criteria:** Each deadline is equal to or later than the previous one.\n- **How to Test:**  \n  - **Automated:** Compare sequence of dates.\n  - **Manual:** Check if dates progress logically.\n- **GOOD Example:**  \n  2024-07-01 → 2024-07-10 → 2024-07-15\n- **POOR Example:**  \n  2024-07-15 → 2024-07-01 → 2024-07-10\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Suggest NEW Assertions (UX-Focused & Testable)**\n\n1. **Assertion 6: Status Legend Present**\n   - **Statement:** If custom status terms are used, a legend must be provided.\n   - **Pass/Fail:** Legend exists if any status is not in {Not Started, In Progress, Complete}.\n   - **Test:** Automated keyword check or manual scan.\n   - **GOOD:** “Status Legend: NS = Not Started, IP = In Progress.”\n   - **POOR:** Uses “Pending” and “Blocked” without explanation.\n\n2. **Assertion 7: No Empty Cells**\n   - **Statement:** No blank cells in `Task`, `Owner`, `Deadline`, `Status`.\n   - **Pass/Fail:** All required fields populated.\n   - **Test:** Automated null check.\n   - **GOOD:** All rows complete.\n   - **POOR:** Some tasks missing owners.\n\n3. **Assertion 8: Owner Names Consistent**\n   - **Statement:** Owner names must be consistent (no duplicates with different spellings).\n   - **Pass/Fail:** No variation in case or spelling for same person.\n   - **Test:** Automated normalization check.\n   - **GOOD:** “Alice” everywhere.\n   - **POOR:** “Alice”, “alice”, “A. Smith”.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Rename S20**\n\nCurrent: **S20: Presentation & Readability**  \nProposed:  \n- **S20: First-Use Clarity & Visual Trust**  \n- **S20: Structure & Immediate Comprehension**  \n- **S20: Clarity & Engagement**  \n\nBest option: **S20: Clarity & First Impression** (captures UX intent and testable structure).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: GOOD vs POOR Examples Summary**\n\n| Assertion | GOOD | POOR |\n|-----------|------|------|\n| Required Columns | Task | Owner | Deadline | Status | Activity | Person | Due Date | Progress |\n| Goal Statement | “Goal: Deliver assets by Aug 30.” | No goal present |\n| Task Length | “Create homepage wireframes.” | “Create homepage wireframes including responsive breakpoints and accessibility.” |\n| Date Format | 2024-07-15 | July 15th, 2024 |\n| Chronological | 2024-07-01 → 2024-07-10 | 2024-07-15 → 2024-07-01 |\n| Status Legend | “Legend: NS = Not Started.” | Uses “Pending” without explanation |\n| No Empty Cells | All fields filled | Missing owner |\n| Owner Consistency | “Alice” everywhere | “Alice”, “alice” |\n\n---\n\n✅ **Next Steps:**  \nWould you like me to **draft the full S20 evaluation checklist** (with all assertions, scoring rubric, and automated/manual test instructions) so it can be integrated into your WBP evaluation framework?",
