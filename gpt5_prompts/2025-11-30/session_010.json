      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP). A WBP works backward from T-0 (plan completion date) to the present.\n\nQuestion about S18: Post-Event Actions\nCurrent definition: 'Follow-up tasks after the meeting with owners and deadlines'\nCurrent assertions:\n- S18_A1: 'Post-meeting [TASK] items must have assigned [OWNER] and [DUE_DATE]'\n- S18_A2: 'Follow-up [ACTION_ITEM] must be traceable to meeting discussions'\n\nClarification: S18 is about POST-T-0 tasks - things like:\n- Retrospective/post-mortem meetings\n- Lessons learned documentation\n- Project closure activities\n- Follow-up reviews\n\nThese tasks happen AFTER the plan completion date (T-0), not before.\n\nContext:\n- WBP core scope: Tasks working backward from T-0 to present (all tasks BEFORE T-0)\n- G4_A4 already handles post-T-0 artifacts: 'Post-mortem ARTIFACT existence verified after T-0'\n- We've marked operational dimensions as N/A and aspirational dimensions accordingly\n\nQuestions:\n1. Are post-T-0 tasks (retrospectives, post-mortems) within the scope of a WBP?\n2. Is including post-T-0 tasks a sign of mature planning (ASPIRATIONAL) or outside WBP scope (N/A)?\n3. If kept, should S18 be ASPIRATIONAL (nice-to-have, not penalized if missing)?\n\nOptions:\nA) Mark S18 as N/A - post-T-0 tasks are outside WBP scope (WBP = work backward FROM T-0)\nB) Mark S18 as ASPIRATIONAL - including post-T-0 tasks shows mature planning but not required\nC) Keep S18 as is - post-T-0 tasks are part of complete project planning\n\nPlease provide your recommendation with reasoning.",
      "answer": "Great question — this is a classic scope-boundary issue in planning frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis**\n\n1. **Are post-T-0 tasks within the scope of a WBP?**\n   - By definition, a **Work-Back Plan (WBP)** works backward from **T-0 (completion date)** to the present.  \n   - The **core WBP scope** is *tasks leading up to T-0*, ensuring readiness for the event or deliverable.  \n   - Post-T-0 activities (retrospectives, lessons learned, closure) occur **after the event** and do not influence readiness for T-0.  \n   - Therefore, **post-T-0 tasks are not part of the core WBP scope**.\n\n2. **Is including post-T-0 tasks a sign of mature planning or outside scope?**\n   - Including post-T-0 tasks demonstrates **end-to-end lifecycle thinking** and **mature project management practices**.  \n   - However, it is **not essential for WBP compliance**, since WBP is focused on pre-T-0 readiness.  \n   - So, it is **outside the core scope**, but **valuable as an aspirational indicator**.\n\n3. **If kept, should S18 be ASPIRATIONAL?**\n   - Yes. If you want to encourage best practices without penalizing teams for omission, mark it as **ASPIRATIONAL**.  \n   - This aligns with your existing approach: operational dimensions = N/A for post-T-0, aspirational = optional maturity signal.\n\n---\n\n### **Options Evaluation**\n\n- **A) N/A**  \n  Pros: Strict adherence to WBP definition.  \n  Cons: Misses an opportunity to encourage maturity.\n\n- **B) ASPIRATIONAL** ✅ *Recommended*  \n  Pros: Keeps WBP definition intact while rewarding teams that plan beyond T-0.  \n  Cons: Slight complexity in scoring, but manageable.\n\n- **C) Keep as is (Required)**  \n  Cons: Misaligns with WBP definition, penalizes teams for something outside core scope.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**\n\n**Option B: Mark S18 as ASPIRATIONAL.**  \nReasoning:\n- WBP’s formal scope ends at T-0, so post-T-0 tasks should not be mandatory.\n- Including them signals advanced planning maturity, which is valuable but optional.\n- This approach aligns with your existing G4_A4 handling and avoids scope creep.\n\n---\n\n#### **Updated Definition for S18**\n> *\"Post-event actions planned beyond T-0 (e.g., retrospectives, lessons learned, closure activities). Inclusion indicates mature planning but is not required for WBP compliance.\"*\n\n#### **Assertions**\n- Keep S18_A1 and S18_A2 as **aspirational checks**, not required for baseline compliance.\n\n---\n\n✅ Would you like me to **draft a scoring rubric snippet** showing how S18 would be evaluated as ASPIRATIONAL (e.g., 0 points if missing, bonus points if present)?",
