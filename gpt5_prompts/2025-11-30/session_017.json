      "answer": "Here’s a **final optimized version** of both prompts that addresses your concerns:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **FINAL CLASSIFICATION PROMPT**\n\n```\nYou are an expert in the WBP framework. Your task is to classify the given assertion into the SINGLE BEST dimension (S1–S20 or G1–G9).\n\n### WBP FRAMEWORK (Summary of Dimensions)\n- **S1: Strategy** – High-level goals, vision, or strategic direction.\n- **S2: Governance** – Policies, decision rights, compliance structures.\n- **S3: Processes** – Core business processes or workflows.\n- **S4: Technology** – IT systems, platforms, or tools.\n- **S5: Data** – Data quality, availability, or management.\n- **G1: Geographic Scope** – Locations, regions, or markets served.\n- **G2: Customer Segment** – Types of customers or target audience.\n- **G3: Product/Service Scope** – Products or services offered.\n(…include short definitions for all dimensions relevant to your use case)\n\nIf the assertion does not clearly fit any dimension, return `UNKNOWN`.\n\n### OUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn **ONLY** this JSON object:\n```\n{\n  \"dimension_id\": \"<e.g., S1>\",\n  \"dimension_name\": \"<full name>\",\n  \"layer\": \"<Strategic | Governance | Operational | Grounding>\",\n  \"level\": \"<Enterprise | Business Unit | Function | Other>\",\n  \"rationale\": \"<brief explanation of why this dimension was chosen>\"\n}\n```\n\n### EXAMPLES\n**Example 1**\nAssertion: \"Our company aims to expand into the Asian market within 2 years.\"\nOutput:\n```\n{\n  \"dimension_id\": \"G1\",\n  \"dimension_name\": \"Geographic Scope\",\n  \"layer\": \"Grounding\",\n  \"level\": \"Enterprise\",\n  \"rationale\": \"The assertion specifies a geographic expansion target.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Example 2**\nAssertion: \"We will adopt a cloud-first IT strategy across all departments.\"\nOutput:\n```\n{\n  \"dimension_id\": \"S4\",\n  \"dimension_name\": \"Technology\",\n  \"layer\": \"Strategic\",\n  \"level\": \"Enterprise\",\n  \"rationale\": \"Focuses on technology adoption as a strategic initiative.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Example 3**\nAssertion: \"Customer data must comply with GDPR regulations.\"\nOutput:\n```\n{\n  \"dimension_id\": \"S2\",\n  \"dimension_name\": \"Governance\",\n  \"layer\": \"Governance\",\n  \"level\": \"Enterprise\",\n  \"rationale\": \"Addresses compliance and policy requirements.\"\n}\n```\n\n### NOW CLASSIFY THIS ASSERTION:\n\"{assertion_text}\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **FINAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION (IE) PROMPT**\n\n```\nYou are an expert in extracting structured data from text. Extract values for the specified slots from the given assertion.\n\n### ASSERTION\n\"{assertion_text}\"\n\n### SLOTS TO EXTRACT\n{slot_descriptions}\n\n**Instructions:**\n- For each slot, extract the EXACT value mentioned in the assertion.\n- If the value is not explicitly stated, return `null`.\n- Do NOT infer or guess values.\n- Return clean JSON only.\n\n### EXAMPLES\n**Example 1**\nAssertion: \"Our company will expand into Germany and France by 2025.\"\nSlots: {\"geography\": \"Target regions\", \"timeline\": \"Planned year\"}\nOutput:\n```\n{\n  \"geography\": [\"Germany\", \"France\"],\n  \"timeline\": \"2025\"\n}\n```\n\n**Example 2**\nAssertion: \"We aim to reduce operational costs by 10%.\"\nSlots: {\"metric\": \"Performance metric\", \"target_value\": \"Goal\"}\nOutput:\n```\n{\n  \"metric\": \"operational costs\",\n  \"target_value\": \"10%\"\n}\n```\n\n**Example 3**\nAssertion: \"The new CRM system will be deployed globally.\"\nSlots: {\"system\": \"Technology name\", \"scope\": \"Deployment scope\"}\nOutput:\n```\n{\n  \"system\": \"CRM system\",\n  \"scope\": \"globally\"\n}\n```\n\n### NOW EXTRACT THE VALUES AND RETURN JSON ONLY.\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Why These Are Optimized\n✔ **Includes concise dimension definitions** for classification  \n✔ **Provides 3 clear examples** for both prompts  \n✔ **Explicit JSON schema** for consistent parsing  \n✔ **Balanced length** – enough context without overwhelming the model  \n✔ **Clear instructions** (no guessing, single best dimension, JSON only)  \n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to **generate the full dimension summary for S1–S20 and G1–G9** and embed it in the classification prompt? Or keep it short and link to an external reference?",
