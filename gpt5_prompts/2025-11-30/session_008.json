      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP). We have Structural dimensions (S1-S20) that define WHAT should be in a WBP, and Grounding dimensions (G1-G8) that verify slot values against the source scenario.\n\nCurrent Grounding Dimensions:\n- G1: Hallucination Check - ENTITY, ATTENDEE, ARTIFACT must exist in scenario\n- G2: Attendee Grounding - OWNER must be from scenario attendee list\n- G3: Date/Time Grounding - DUE_DATE, DATE must be consistent with scenario timeline\n- G4: Artifact Grounding - ARTIFACT (input) must exist; DELIVERABLE must have spec\n- G5: Topic Grounding - TOPIC must align with scenario discussion points\n- G6: Action Item Grounding - TASK must trace to scenario ACTION_ITEM\n- G7: Context Preservation - preserve original scenario context\n- G8: Instruction Adherence - follow scenario instructions\n\nWe've added NEW slot types that need grounding rules:\n\n1. [GOAL] - The plan's objective/target outcome (e.g., 'Launch AI Search Feature')\n2. [ASSUMPTION] - Condition believed true at planning time (e.g., 'budget approved by April 10')\n3. [BLOCKER] - Known obstacle (e.g., 'designer unavailable', 'budget approval delayed')\n4. [MITIGATION] - Action to address blocker (e.g., 'use backup designer')\n5. [SKILL] - Expertise required for task (e.g., 'design expertise', 'legal review')\n6. [ESCALATION_CONTACT] - Person with authority for escalation (e.g., 'VP Engineering')\n7. [RESOURCE] - Non-people resource (e.g., 'budget approval', 'server access')\n8. [UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD] - Time window when OWNER unavailable (e.g., 'April 20-25')\n\nFor each slot type, classify as:\nA) GROUNDED: Must come from scenario (specify which G dimension)\nB) DERIVED: Can be reasonably inferred from scenario context\nC) PLANNER-GENERATED: Planner can create reasonable values (no grounding penalty)\nD) CONDITIONAL: Only grounded if scenario provides the information\n\nKey design question: The purpose of grounding is to prevent HALLUCINATION (making up false facts). But planners adding reasonable blockers/assumptions is GOOD planning, not hallucination. How should we distinguish:\n- Hallucination (bad): Inventing attendees, dates, artifacts not in scenario\n- Good planning (good): Identifying reasonable blockers, assumptions, mitigations\n\nRecommend classification for each slot and whether to add new G dimensions or extend existing ones.",
      "answer": "Great question! You’ve clearly articulated the tension between **grounding for factual accuracy** and **allowing creative, reasonable planning**. The key principle should be:\n\n✅ **Grounding applies to facts that are explicitly stated in the scenario (attendees, dates, artifacts, instructions).**  \n✅ **Planning creativity is allowed for forward-looking elements (assumptions, blockers, mitigations), as long as they don’t contradict the scenario.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Distinction**\n- **Hallucination (BAD)**: Introducing **false facts about the given scenario** (e.g., new attendees, fake deadlines, artifacts that don’t exist).\n- **Good Planning (GOOD)**: Adding **reasonable future-oriented elements** (e.g., assumptions, risks, mitigations) that are not explicitly in the scenario but do not contradict it.\n\nSo, grounding should **enforce fidelity to scenario facts**, not penalize reasonable extrapolation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Classification of New Slots**\n\n| Slot Type              | Classification      | Rationale                                                                 |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **GOAL**              | **D) CONDITIONAL** | If scenario states a goal, must match (G7: Context Preservation). If not, planner can define. |\n| **ASSUMPTION**        | **C) PLANNER-GENERATED** | Assumptions are forward-looking; scenario rarely lists all. No grounding penalty unless contradictory. |\n| **BLOCKER**           | **C) PLANNER-GENERATED** | Identifying risks is good planning; allow creativity unless scenario explicitly forbids. |\n| **MITIGATION**        | **C) PLANNER-GENERATED** | Same as blockers; creative planning allowed. |\n| **SKILL**             | **B) DERIVED**     | Should be inferable from tasks/deliverables in scenario (e.g., if design task exists → design skill). |\n| **ESCALATION_CONTACT**| **D) CONDITIONAL** | If scenario provides escalation contact, must match (G2: Attendee Grounding). If not, planner can propose. |\n| **RESOURCE**          | **B) DERIVED**     | Often inferable from deliverables/tasks (e.g., budget, server access). If scenario states resource, must match. |\n| **UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD**| **D) CONDITIONAL** | If scenario mentions unavailability, must match (G3: Date/Time Grounding). Otherwise, planner can add. |\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Grounding Rules for New Slots**\nWe **do NOT need a new G dimension for every slot**. Instead, extend existing ones and add one new dimension for scenario-consistency of assumptions/blockers.\n\n#### **Extensions**\n- **G1 (Hallucination Check)**: Extend to cover GOAL and ESCALATION_CONTACT when scenario specifies them.\n- **G2 (Attendee Grounding)**: Already covers OWNER and can cover ESCALATION_CONTACT if scenario provides.\n- **G3 (Date/Time Grounding)**: Extend to UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD if scenario specifies.\n- **G7 (Context Preservation)**: Ensure GOAL aligns with scenario intent.\n\n#### **New Dimension**\n- **G9: Consistency Check for Planner-Generated Elements**  \n  *Definition*: Assumptions, blockers, mitigations, and resources must **not contradict scenario facts**.  \n  *Purpose*: Allows creative planning but prevents contradictions (e.g., assuming “budget approved” when scenario says “budget rejected”).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Summary Table**\n\n| Slot        | Classification       | Grounding Rule |\n|------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| GOAL       | CONDITIONAL         | If scenario states → G7; else planner defines |\n| ASSUMPTION | PLANNER-GENERATED   | G9: Must not contradict scenario |\n| BLOCKER    | PLANNER-GENERATED   | G9: Must not contradict scenario |\n| MITIGATION | PLANNER-GENERATED   | G9: Must not contradict scenario |\n| SKILL      | DERIVED             | G9: Must be plausible given tasks |\n| ESCALATION_CONTACT | CONDITIONAL | If scenario states → G2; else planner defines |\n| RESOURCE   | DERIVED             | G9: Must be plausible given tasks |\n| UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD | CONDITIONAL | If scenario states → G3; else planner defines |\n\n---\n\n### **Key Design Principle**\n- **Grounding = fidelity to scenario facts.**\n- **Creativity = allowed for forward-looking slots, as long as no contradiction.**\n- Add **G9: Consistency Check** to formalize this.\n\n---\n\n✅ Would you like me to **draft the updated Grounding Dimensions list (G1–G9) with precise definitions and examples**, and also **provide a visual decision tree for slot classification**?",
