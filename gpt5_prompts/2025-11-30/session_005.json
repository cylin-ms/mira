      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP). A WBP is a backward-scheduled project plan that works from a target completion date (T-0) back to the present, listing tasks, owners, due dates, deliverables, and dependencies.\n\nContext from our design principles:\n- Core WBP quality = completeness of tasks, logical sequencing/dependencies, accurate dates aligned to T-0, clear ownership\n- We distinguish between REQUIRED dimensions (core plan structure) vs ASPIRATIONAL dimensions (nice-to-have quality indicators)\n- We distinguish between PLANNING concerns (what tasks exist) vs OPERATIONAL/EXECUTION concerns (how to do tasks)\n- S6 (Dependencies, Blockers & Mitigation) handles known obstacles with this design:\n  - Identifying blockers is ASPIRATIONAL - depends on planner experience\n  - A WBP without identified blockers is not penalized\n  - If blockers ARE identified, they must have mitigation + owner\n  - Structure: BLOCKER -> MITIGATION -> OWNER\n- S10 (Resource-Aware Planning) is CONDITIONAL - only applies if user provides resource constraints\n\nQuestion about S16: Assumptions & Prerequisites\nCurrent definition: 'Stated assumptions and conditions that must be true for the plan to succeed'\nCurrent assertions:\n- S16_A1: 'Assumptions must be explicitly stated and relate to [TOPIC] or [TASK] prerequisites'\n- S16_A2: 'Each assumption must state its impact if invalidated' (e.g., 'if budget not approved, campaign delayed 2 weeks')\n\nObservations:\n- Assumptions are conditions assumed TRUE for the plan to work\n- If an assumption is invalidated, it becomes a blocker (covered by S6)\n- Identifying assumptions is experience-dependent (like identifying blockers)\n- Many WBPs don't have explicit 'Assumptions' sections\n\nShould S16 (Assumptions & Prerequisites) be:\n1. Kept as a separate ASPIRATIONAL dimension (like S6 blockers - not penalized if missing)\n2. Merged into S6 (assumption failure = blocker; both are risk-related)\n3. Marked as N/A (assumptions sections are not standard in WBPs)\n\nConsider:\n- Are assumptions conceptually different enough from blockers to warrant a separate dimension?\n- Is the relationship 'invalidated assumption = blocker' accurate?\n- Would merging simplify the framework without losing evaluative power?\n- Is documenting assumptions a planning quality indicator or just good practice?\n\nPlease provide your recommendation with reasoning.",
      "answer": "Great question—this touches on conceptual clarity, framework simplicity, and evaluative rigor. Let’s break it down systematically.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Conceptual Distinction: Assumptions vs. Blockers**\n- **Assumptions**: Conditions believed to be true at planning time (e.g., \"Budget approval will happen by June 1\"). They are not currently obstacles; they are *uncertainties* that, if false, create risk.\n- **Blockers**: Known obstacles or dependencies that *already exist* and must be resolved for progress (e.g., \"Vendor contract not signed yet\").\n- **Relationship**: If an assumption fails, it *creates* a blocker, but at planning time, assumptions are not blockers—they are potential risk triggers.\n\nSo, assumptions and blockers are related but not identical:\n- Blockers = present constraints\n- Assumptions = future uncertainties\n\n---\n\n### **2. Current Framework Design Principles**\n- **S6 (Blockers)**: ASPIRATIONAL, not penalized if empty, but if present, must have mitigation + owner.\n- **S16 (Assumptions)**: Currently ASPIRATIONAL, requires explicit statement and impact if invalidated.\n\nBoth are experience-dependent and risk-oriented, but:\n- Blockers are operationally actionable now.\n- Assumptions are strategic/contextual and inform risk posture.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Evaluative Impact**\n- If we **merge S16 into S6**, we simplify the framework but risk losing visibility into a distinct planning quality signal: *Has the planner thought about underlying conditions?*\n- If we **keep S16 separate**, we preserve that signal, but at the cost of framework complexity and possible redundancy.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Is documenting assumptions a planning quality indicator?**\nYes. Explicit assumptions:\n- Improve transparency and stakeholder alignment.\n- Help future risk management.\n- Indicate planner maturity.\n\nHowever, because assumptions are not standard in WBPs and are experience-driven, they should remain **ASPIRATIONAL**, not REQUIRED.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Recommendation**\n**Keep S16 as a separate ASPIRATIONAL dimension.**  \n**Reasoning:**\n- Conceptual difference: Assumptions ≠ Blockers (different time horizon and purpose).\n- Evaluative value: Captures planner foresight beyond immediate obstacles.\n- Consistency: Similar to S6 in being ASPIRATIONAL and non-penalizing if absent.\n- Practicality: Mark as “nice-to-have” for advanced planning quality, not mandatory.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Guidance**\n- Clarify in documentation:  \n  - *Assumptions = conditions believed true; if false, may create blockers (then handled under S6).*  \n  - *S16 is about foresight, not current impediments.*\n- Suggested assertion refinement:\n  - **S16_A1:** Assumptions must be explicitly stated and tied to prerequisites or external conditions.\n  - **S16_A2:** Each assumption should state its potential impact if invalidated (optional but recommended).\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Answer:**  \n**Option 1: Keep S16 as a separate ASPIRATIONAL dimension.**  \nDo **not** merge with S6 because assumptions and blockers differ in nature and timing. This preserves evaluative nuance and signals planner maturity without penalizing absence.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **draft a concise definition and scoring rubric for S16** (aligned with your framework style)?",
