      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP). A WBP is a backward-scheduled project plan that works from a target completion date (T-0) back to the present, listing tasks, owners, due dates, deliverables, and dependencies.\n\nWe have two related dimensions:\n- S6: Dependencies, Blockers & Mitigation - covers task dependencies, identified blockers, and mitigation steps with owners\n- S13: Escalation Protocol - covers escalation contacts and escalation triggers (conditions that initiate escalation)\n\nQuestion: Should 'Escalation Protocol' (S13) be:\n1. Kept as a separate dimension\n2. Merged into S6 (Blockers & Mitigation) since escalation is one type of mitigation strategy\n3. Marked as N/A (not applicable to WBP - it's an operational/execution concern)\n\nConsider:\n- Is escalation protocol common practice in WBPs specifically?\n- Is escalation just a special case of blocker mitigation?\n- Does having a separate escalation dimension add value, or is it redundant?\n\nPlease provide your recommendation with reasoning.",
      "answer": "Great question—this is about balancing conceptual clarity with practical usefulness in your quality evaluation framework.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of the Three Options**\n\n#### **1. Keep S13 (Escalation Protocol) as a Separate Dimension**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Highlights the importance of escalation readiness, which is critical in high-stakes or time-sensitive projects.\n  - Provides visibility into governance and accountability beyond immediate task-level mitigation.\n  - Useful for evaluating plans in organizations where escalation is a formal requirement (e.g., regulated industries, large programs).\n- **Cons:**\n  - Escalation typically comes into play during execution, not planning. WBPs are primarily planning artifacts.\n  - May feel redundant if the WBP already includes mitigation strategies for blockers.\n\n#### **2. Merge S13 into S6 (Dependencies, Blockers & Mitigation)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Conceptually clean: escalation is indeed a mitigation mechanism for unresolved blockers.\n  - Reduces dimensional complexity and avoids redundancy.\n  - Keeps the evaluation framework focused on planning essentials.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Risk of underemphasizing escalation if it's buried under a broader \"mitigation\" category.\n  - Requires clear guidance that escalation triggers and contacts must be documented as part of mitigation.\n\n#### **3. Mark S13 as N/A for WBPs**\n- **Pros:**\n  - WBPs are typically planning tools, not operational playbooks. Escalation is often handled in execution governance documents (e.g., RAID logs, comms plans).\n  - Simplifies the framework.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Removes an important risk management element from the plan, which could be problematic for critical deadlines.\n  - If escalation is omitted entirely, the WBP may lack a clear path for resolving high-impact blockers.\n\n---\n\n### **Industry Practice**\n- In most organizations, **escalation protocols are not standard in WBPs**; they are usually part of risk management or project governance documentation.\n- WBPs focus on tasks, dependencies, and timing—not escalation chains.\n- However, for **high-visibility or time-critical projects**, escalation readiness can be a quality differentiator.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**\n**Option 2: Merge S13 into S6, but explicitly require escalation details when relevant.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Escalation is logically a subset of mitigation: when a blocker cannot be resolved at the current level, escalation is the mitigation step.\n- Keeping it separate adds complexity and redundancy without strong justification, since escalation is rarely a standalone WBP element.\n- Marking it N/A would ignore an important risk control for time-sensitive projects.\n- Best approach: **define S6 to include three sub-elements:**\n  - Dependencies\n  - Blockers & Mitigation steps\n  - *Escalation path (contacts and triggers) as part of mitigation strategy*\n\n---\n\n### **How to Implement**\nUpdate S6 definition to:\n> **S6: Dependencies, Blockers & Mitigation (including Escalation)**  \n> Evaluates whether the WBP clearly identifies task dependencies, potential blockers, mitigation strategies, and—where applicable—escalation paths (contacts and triggers) for unresolved blockers.\n\n---\n\n✅ This approach keeps the framework lean, avoids redundancy, and ensures escalation is addressed without overcomplicating the evaluation.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **draft a revised scoring rubric for S6 that incorporates escalation explicitly**?",
