      "answer": "Here’s an **optimized prompt** you can use to accurately decompose free-form assertions into atomic S+G units according to your framework:\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt Text**\n\nYou are an expert in requirements decomposition. Your task is to **convert a single free-form assertion into a JSON array of atomic S+G units** based on the given S (structural) and G (grounding) dimensions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Instructions**\n\n1. **Decompose the assertion into atomic units**:\n   - Each atomic unit corresponds to **exactly one S dimension** (structural requirement).\n   - If the assertion contains multiple structural requirements, create multiple atomic units.\n   - If the assertion is purely about grounding (G) without any structural requirement, create an atomic unit with `\"s_dimension\": null` and `\"s_assertion\": null`.\n\n2. **For each atomic unit**:\n   - Include:\n     - `\"s_dimension\"`: the S code (e.g., `\"S1\"`) or `null` if none.\n     - `\"s_name\"`: the S dimension name or `null` if none.\n     - `\"s_assertion\"`: a clear statement of the structural requirement (or `null` if none).\n     - `\"linked_g\"`: an array of grounding checks relevant to this structural requirement.\n       - Each grounding check includes:\n         - `\"g_dimension\"`: the G code (e.g., `\"G5\"`).\n         - `\"g_name\"`: the G dimension name.\n         - `\"slot_value\"`: the specific value from the assertion that must match the source.\n\n3. **Use the provided mappings**:\n   - S→G mappings define which G dimensions typically link to which S dimensions.\n   - If the assertion mentions a value that should match the source, include the corresponding G dimension and the extracted slot value.\n\n4. **Output format**:\n   - A **JSON array** of objects, each representing one atomic unit.\n   - Do not include extra text outside the JSON.\n\n---\n\n#### **S Dimensions**\n- S1: Title - meeting/event title\n- S2: Timeline Alignment - time constraints, tight timeline\n- S3: Ownership Assignment - task owner\n- S4: Participant Identification - attendees, stakeholders\n- S5: Task Dates - when tasks happen\n- S6: Risk Assessment - risks, escalation\n- S8: Task Descriptions - what tasks involve\n- S9: Success Criteria - definition of done\n- S10: Buffer Time - contingency time\n- S16: Assumptions & Prerequisites - stated assumptions\n- S17: Dependencies - task dependencies\n- S18: Milestones - key checkpoints\n- S19: Communication Plan - sharing, notification\n- S20: Review & Approval - review cycles\n\n#### **G Dimensions**\n- G1: Hallucination Prevention - no invented details\n- G2: Attendee Grounding - names match source\n- G3: Date/Time Grounding - dates match source\n- G4: Artifact Grounding - files match source\n- G5: Topic Grounding - topics match source\n- G6: Action Item Grounding - tasks match source\n- G7: Role Grounding - roles match source\n- G8: Constraint Grounding - limits match source\n- G9: Planner-Generated Consistency - generated content consistent\n\n#### **S→G Mappings**\n- S1 → G5\n- S3 → G2, G6\n- S4 → G2, G7\n- S5 → G3\n- S16 → G5, G6, G9\n- S19 → G2, G4, G6\n\n---\n\n#### **Example**\n\n**Input Assertion:**\n```\nThe response should state that the meeting '1:1 Action Items Review' is scheduled for July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST.\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"s_dimension\": \"S1\",\n    \"s_name\": \"Title\",\n    \"s_assertion\": \"The response must state the meeting title\",\n    \"linked_g\": [\n      {\n        \"g_dimension\": \"G5\",\n        \"g_name\": \"Topic Grounding\",\n        \"slot_value\": \"1:1 Action Items Review\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"s_dimension\": \"S5\",\n    \"s_name\": \"Task Dates\",\n    \"s_assertion\": \"The response must state the meeting date/time\",\n    \"linked_g\": [\n      {\n        \"g_dimension\": \"G3\",\n        \"g_name\": \"Date/Time Grounding\",\n        \"slot_value\": \"July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Now process this assertion:**\n```\n{{FREE_FORM_ASSERTION}}\n```\n\nReturn **only the JSON array** as the output.\n\n---\n\n✅ This prompt enforces:\n- Strict decomposition into atomic S+G units\n- Correct mapping of S→G\n- Extraction of slot values\n- Handling of pure G assertions\n- Clean JSON output\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **also provide a few more worked examples (including tricky cases like multiple participants, assumptions, or pure grounding checks)** to make the model more robust?",
