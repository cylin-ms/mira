      "answer": "Here’s an **optimized prompt** you can use to instruct a model to perform the decomposition of free-form assertions into atomic S+G units according to your framework:\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt Text**\n\nYou are an expert in decomposing complex assertions into atomic evaluation units based on the S+G framework.  \nYour task is to take a **free-form assertion** and break it down into a JSON array of atomic units. Each unit must test exactly **one structural requirement (S dimension)** and include any linked grounding checks (G dimensions) with extracted slot values.\n\n---\n\n#### **Framework Details**\n\n- **S Dimensions (Structural Requirements)**:  \n  - S1: Title – meeting/event title  \n  - S2: Timeline Alignment – time constraints, tight timeline  \n  - S3: Ownership Assignment – task owner  \n  - S4: Participant Identification – attendees, stakeholders  \n  - S5: Task Dates – when tasks happen  \n  - S6: Risk Assessment – risks, escalation  \n  - S8: Task Descriptions – what tasks involve  \n  - S9: Success Criteria – definition of done  \n  - S10: Buffer Time – contingency time  \n  - S16: Assumptions & Prerequisites – stated assumptions  \n  - S17: Dependencies – task dependencies  \n  - S18: Milestones – key checkpoints  \n  - S19: Communication Plan – sharing, notification  \n  - S20: Review & Approval – review cycles  \n\n- **G Dimensions (Grounding Checks)**:  \n  - G1: Hallucination Prevention – no invented details  \n  - G2: Attendee Grounding – names match source  \n  - G3: Date/Time Grounding – dates match source  \n  - G4: Artifact Grounding – files match source  \n  - G5: Topic Grounding – topics match source  \n  - G6: Action Item Grounding – tasks match source  \n  - G7: Role Grounding – roles match source  \n  - G8: Constraint Grounding – limits match source  \n  - G9: Planner-Generated Consistency – generated content consistent  \n\n- **Mapping Rules**:  \n  - S1 → G5  \n  - S3 → G2, G6  \n  - S4 → G2, G7  \n  - S5 → G3  \n  - S16 → G5, G6, G9  \n  - S19 → G2, G4, G6  \n\n---\n\n#### **Decomposition Rules**\n1. **Split the assertion into atomic units**: Each unit should correspond to exactly one S dimension.  \n2. **If the assertion contains multiple structural requirements, create multiple units**.  \n3. **For each unit**:\n   - Include:\n     - `s_dimension`: the S code (e.g., \"S1\")\n     - `s_name`: the S dimension name\n     - `s_assertion`: a clear description of what the response must include for this structural requirement\n     - `linked_g`: an array of grounding checks relevant to this S dimension, each with:\n       - `g_dimension`: G code (e.g., \"G5\")\n       - `g_name`: G dimension name\n       - `slot_value`: the specific value from the assertion that must match the source\n4. If the assertion is **purely grounding-related** (no structural requirement), create a unit with `\"s_dimension\": null` and only the `linked_g` checks.\n5. Output **only a JSON array**, no extra text.\n\n---\n\n#### **Example**\n\n**Input Assertion:**  \n\"The response should state that the meeting '1:1 Action Items Review' is scheduled for July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST.\"\n\n**Output:**  \n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"s_dimension\": \"S1\",\n    \"s_name\": \"Title\",\n    \"s_assertion\": \"The response must state the meeting title\",\n    \"linked_g\": [\n      {\n        \"g_dimension\": \"G5\",\n        \"g_name\": \"Topic Grounding\",\n        \"slot_value\": \"1:1 Action Items Review\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"s_dimension\": \"S5\",\n    \"s_name\": \"Task Dates\",\n    \"s_assertion\": \"The response must state the meeting date/time\",\n    \"linked_g\": [\n      {\n        \"g_dimension\": \"G3\",\n        \"g_name\": \"Date/Time Grounding\",\n        \"slot_value\": \"July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **Now perform this decomposition for the following assertion:**  \n`{{ASSERTION_TEXT}}`\n\n---\n\n### **How to Use**\n- Replace `{{ASSERTION_TEXT}}` with the actual free-form assertion.\n- Ensure the model outputs **only the JSON array** following the described structure.\n\n---\n\n✅ This prompt is optimized because:\n- It clearly defines the framework and mappings.\n- It enforces atomicity and JSON-only output.\n- It provides an example for clarity.\n- It handles mixed and purely grounding assertions.\n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **also provide a few more worked examples** (including edge cases like multiple participants, assumptions, or pure grounding checks) so you can test the prompt?",
