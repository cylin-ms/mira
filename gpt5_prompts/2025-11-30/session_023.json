      "question": "We are designing an assertion framework for evaluating Workback Plan (WBP) generation. We have two layers: Structural (S1-S20) for checking WBP structure, and Grounding (G1-G9) for verifying facts against a source scenario.\n\nCurrent G dimensions are all ENTITY grounding:\n- G1: Hallucination Check (entities not fabricated)\n- G2: Attendee Grounding (people match attendee list)\n- G3: Date/Time Grounding (dates match scenario)\n- G4: Artifact Grounding (files/docs match scenario)\n- G5: Topic Grounding (topics match agenda)\n- G6: Action Item Grounding (tasks match scenario)\n- G7: Context Preservation (meeting context preserved)\n- G8: Instruction Adherence (follows user instructions)\n- G9: Planner-Generated Consistency (assumptions/blockers don't contradict)\n\nWe discovered that assertions like 'prerequisite tasks must be scheduled before dependent tasks' require RELATION grounding - verifying that the RELATIONSHIP between entities (e.g., DEPENDS_ON(TaskA, TaskB)) is grounded in the scenario, not just that the entities exist.\n\nWe defined 5 relation types: DEPENDS_ON, BLOCKS, OWNS, PRODUCES, REQUIRES_INPUT.\n\nQuestion: Should we add G10: Relation Grounding as a new dimension? Or should relation grounding be handled by existing G dimensions (e.g., G6 for action items)? What is your recommendation and reasoning?",
      "answer": "Great question. This touches on the conceptual clarity of your evaluation framework and its ability to scale.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis**\n\nYour current **G1–G9 dimensions** are all **entity-centric**: they verify that individual entities (people, dates, artifacts, topics, tasks) in the WBP are grounded in the source scenario. For example:\n\n- **G6 (Action Item Grounding)** ensures that each task exists in the scenario.\n- **G3 (Date/Time Grounding)** ensures dates match the scenario.\n\nHowever, **relation grounding** is fundamentally different:\n\n- It checks **constraints between entities** (e.g., Task A must precede Task B because of a dependency).\n- These constraints are **not captured by entity existence checks**. Even if both Task A and Task B are valid (G6 passes), the relationship between them could be fabricated or incorrect.\n\nYour example:\n> \"Prerequisite tasks must be scheduled before dependent tasks\"  \nThis is not about whether the tasks exist (G6), but whether the **ordering relationship** is correct and grounded in the scenario.\n\n---\n\n### **Options**\n\n#### **Option 1: Fold into G6 (Action Item Grounding)**\n- Pros: Keeps the number of dimensions smaller.\n- Cons:\n  - Conceptual overload: G6 would mix two different concerns (entity existence vs. relation correctness).\n  - Harder to measure and report errors precisely (is the problem the task or the dependency?).\n  - Reduces modularity and clarity for future relation types.\n\n#### **Option 2: Add G10: Relation Grounding**\n- Pros:\n  - Clear separation of concerns: entity grounding vs. relation grounding.\n  - Scales well as you add more relation types (DEPENDS_ON, BLOCKS, etc.).\n  - Easier to diagnose and report: “Tasks exist but dependency is wrong” vs. “Task does not exist.”\n- Cons:\n  - Adds another dimension (slightly more complexity in the framework).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**\n\n✅ **Add G10: Relation Grounding as a new dimension.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Relation grounding is conceptually distinct from entity grounding.\n- It requires different evaluation logic (graph-based checks, ordering constraints, etc.).\n- Keeping it separate improves clarity, maintainability, and diagnostic power.\n- Future-proof: if you introduce more complex relationships (e.g., resource allocation, ownership), you won’t overload entity checks.\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Definition**\n\n**G10: Relation Grounding**  \n*Verify that relationships between entities in the WBP (e.g., dependencies, ownership, input requirements) are consistent with and grounded in the source scenario. This includes checking that no fabricated relations are introduced and that all scenario-specified relations are respected.*\n\n---\n\n#### **Example Checks**\n- If scenario says `DEPENDS_ON(TaskA, TaskB)`, then TaskA must be scheduled after TaskB.\n- No fabricated relations: if scenario does not specify `BLOCKS(TaskX, TaskY)`, WBP should not introduce it.\n- Ownership and input requirements match scenario definitions.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **draft a revised G-dimension hierarchy** showing where G10 fits and how it relates to G6? Or also **propose assertion templates for G10 checks**?",
