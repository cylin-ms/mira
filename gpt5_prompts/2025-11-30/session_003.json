      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP). A WBP is a backward-scheduled project plan that works from a target completion date (T-0) back to the present, listing tasks, owners, due dates, deliverables, and dependencies.\n\nContext from our design principles:\n- Core WBP quality = completeness of tasks, logical sequencing/dependencies, accurate dates aligned to T-0, clear ownership\n- We distinguish between REQUIRED dimensions (core plan structure) vs ASPIRATIONAL dimensions (nice-to-have quality indicators)\n- We distinguish between PLANNING concerns (what tasks exist) vs OPERATIONAL/EXECUTION concerns (how to do tasks)\n- We've already merged redundant dimensions: Communication Plan merged into Cross-team Coordination, Escalation Protocol merged into Blockers & Mitigation\n- S9 (Checkpoints) = verification tasks to check progress before T-0 (marked as aspirational)\n\nQuestion about S14: Feedback Integration\nCurrent definition: 'Scheduled checkpoints to validate and iterate the plan'\nCurrent assertions:\n- S14_A1: 'Feedback loops must be tied to [TOPIC] discussions'\n- S14_A2: 'Feedback collection method must be specified for each checkpoint'\n\nShould S14 (Feedback Integration) be:\n1. Kept as a separate dimension\n2. Merged into S9 (Checkpoints) since feedback happens at checkpoints\n3. Marked as N/A (not applicable to WBP - operational/execution concern, or concept is too vague)\n\nConsider:\n- Is 'feedback integration' common practice in WBPs specifically?\n- What does 'feedback loop' mean in a WBP context? Feedback on what, from whom?\n- Does S14 overlap with S9 (Checkpoints)?\n- Is 'feedback collection method (survey, meeting)' a planning concern or operational detail?\n- Can we objectively verify these assertions?\n\nPlease provide your recommendation with reasoning.",
      "answer": "Great question—this is a classic case of deciding whether a dimension is truly part of *planning quality* or if it drifts into *execution governance*. Let’s analyze systematically:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Interpret S14 in WBP Context**\n- **Current definition:** “Scheduled checkpoints to validate and iterate the plan.”\n    - This sounds very similar to S9 (Checkpoints), which already covers scheduled verification tasks before T-0.\n- **Assertions:**\n    - A1: “Feedback loops must be tied to [TOPIC] discussions.” → Implies feedback on the *plan* itself or on progress.\n    - A2: “Feedback collection method must be specified for each checkpoint.” → Specifies *how* feedback is gathered (survey, meeting, etc.), which feels operational.\n\n**Key question:** What is “feedback” about?  \n- If it’s feedback on *plan completeness or accuracy*, that is a planning concern—but typically happens during plan creation, not after approval.\n- If it’s feedback on *execution progress*, that’s operational, not core WBP quality.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Is Feedback Integration Common in WBPs?**\n- WBPs are usually static once approved; they serve as a reference schedule. Iteration is rare unless major assumptions change.\n- Continuous feedback loops are more common in agile or adaptive planning, not in classic WBPs.\n- Therefore, “feedback integration” is not a universal or core practice for WBPs.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Overlap with S9 (Checkpoints)**\n- S9 already requires checkpoints for progress verification before T-0.\n- If feedback is gathered at checkpoints, then S14 is conceptually a subset of S9.\n- The only difference: S14 emphasizes *method of collecting feedback* and *iterating the plan*—but that’s execution detail, not structural quality.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifiability**\n- Can we objectively check S14 assertions?\n    - “Feedback loops tied to [TOPIC] discussions” → Hard to verify without subjective interpretation.\n    - “Feedback collection method specified” → Possible, but this is about meeting logistics, not plan structure.\n- These are weak as structural quality indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Planning vs Operational**\n- Specifying “how feedback is collected” is operational.\n- Iterating the plan based on feedback happens during execution, not initial plan design.\n- Therefore, S14 is not a *planning dimension* in the same sense as task completeness or dependency logic.\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**\n**Option 3: Mark S14 as N/A (not applicable as a core WBP quality dimension).**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Feedback integration is not a standard or essential WBP feature; WBPs are typically fixed reference plans.\n- Assertions are operational and hard to verify objectively.\n- Overlaps heavily with S9 (Checkpoints), which already covers the planning aspect of progress verification.\n- Keeping S14 would dilute the framework with execution governance rather than plan structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative (if you want to preserve the idea)**\n- If stakeholders value feedback loops, fold the concept into S9 as an *aspirational sub-criterion*:  \n    *“Checkpoints include a mechanism for reviewing assumptions and updating the plan if needed.”*  \n  But do **not** keep S14 as a standalone dimension.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Answer:**  \n**S14 should be removed as a separate dimension (mark as N/A) and, if desired, its essence can be absorbed into S9 as an optional aspirational element.**\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **draft a revised definition for S9 that incorporates an optional feedback aspect**? Or **prepare a short rationale summary for stakeholders explaining why S14 was dropped**?",
