      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP).\n\nS20: Clarity & First Impression - currently has 8 assertions about UX/presentation:\n- A1: Required columns (Task, Owner, Deadline, Status)\n- A2: Goal statement in first 3 lines\n- A3: Task descriptions ≤12 words\n- A4: Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format\n- A5: Chronological order by due date\n- A6: No empty required cells\n- A7: Consistent owner name spelling\n- A8: Legend for non-standard status values\n\nDesign principles we're applying:\n- REQUIRED = core structural elements, penalized if missing\n- ASPIRATIONAL = nice-to-have, not penalized if missing, bonus if present\n- Keep framework lean - avoid too many granular rules\n\nQuestions:\n1. Which of A1-A8 are truly REQUIRED vs ASPIRATIONAL for basic WBP clarity?\n2. Is '≤12 words' (A3) too arbitrary? What's the right approach?\n3. Date format (A4) - specific format vs 'consistent format'?\n4. Ordering (A5) - chronological vs 'logical ordering'?\n5. Are there any CRITICAL clarity checks we're missing that should be REQUIRED?\n6. Should we split S20 into 'Core Clarity' (required) and 'Enhanced Clarity' (aspirational)?\n\nGoal: Create a practical, not overly prescriptive framework that catches real clarity issues.",
      "answer": "Great questions! Let’s go through them systematically and design a practical, lean framework.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Which of A1–A8 are truly REQUIRED vs ASPIRATIONAL?**\n\n**REQUIRED (must-have for basic clarity):**\n- **A1: Required columns (Task, Owner, Deadline, Status)**  \n  *Core structural element; without these, the WBP is unusable.*\n- **A2: Goal statement in first 3 lines**  \n  *Provides context; without it, the plan lacks purpose.*\n- **A4: Dates in consistent format** (see Q3 for nuance)  \n  *Inconsistent dates cause confusion and errors.*\n- **A5: Chronological or logical order** (see Q4)  \n  *Disorder makes the plan hard to follow.*\n- **A6: No empty required cells**  \n  *Missing data breaks clarity and accountability.*\n- **A7: Consistent owner name spelling**  \n  *Prevents ambiguity in responsibility.*\n\n**ASPIRATIONAL (nice-to-have, improves polish):**\n- **A3: Task descriptions ≤12 words**  \n  *Helps readability, but arbitrary and not critical.*\n- **A8: Legend for non-standard status values**  \n  *Useful if statuses are non-standard, but not always needed.*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Is '≤12 words' (A3) too arbitrary? What's the right approach?**\n\nYes, **≤12 words is arbitrary and risks being overly prescriptive**. Instead:\n- **Principle:** “Task descriptions should be concise and action-oriented.”  \n- **Check:** Flag if descriptions are excessively long (e.g., >20 words) or contain multiple actions.  \n- **Reason:** The goal is clarity, not word count compliance.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Date format (A4) – specific format vs 'consistent format'?**\n\n- **Recommendation:** Require **consistent format**, not a specific one.  \n- Reason: Teams may use different conventions (YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MMM-YY), but inconsistency is what causes confusion.  \n- **Optional aspirational:** Suggest ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) as best practice for clarity and sorting.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Ordering (A5) – chronological vs 'logical ordering'?**\n\n- **Recommendation:** Require **logical sequence that supports understanding of dependencies**.  \n- Usually this means chronological by due date, but in some cases grouping by phase or workstream is clearer.  \n- **Check wording:** “Tasks are presented in a clear, logical order (typically chronological).”\n\n---\n\n### **5. Are there any CRITICAL clarity checks we're missing that should be REQUIRED?**\n\nYes, consider adding:\n- **Unique task identifiers (IDs or row numbers)** – helps reference tasks in discussion.\n- **Status values interpretable at a glance** – if using color codes or abbreviations, they must be understandable without external context (or require a legend if non-standard).\n- **Plan title and version/date** – so people know what they’re looking at.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Should we split S20 into 'Core Clarity' (required) and 'Enhanced Clarity' (aspirational)?**\n\n**Yes, that’s a great approach.**  \n- **Core Clarity:** A1, A2, A4 (consistency), A5 (logical order), A6, A7, plus any new critical checks (title/version, unique IDs).  \n- **Enhanced Clarity:** A3 (conciseness), A8 (legend), optional best practices (ISO dates, visual cues).\n\nThis keeps the framework lean and practical while rewarding polish.\n\n---\n\n## **Proposed Structure for S20**\n\n### **Core Clarity (Required)**\n- C1: Includes required columns (Task, Owner, Deadline, Status)\n- C2: Goal statement present near top\n- C3: Dates in a consistent format\n- C4: Tasks in a clear, logical order\n- C5: No empty required cells\n- C6: Owner names spelled consistently\n- C7: Plan has title and version/date\n- C8: Status values interpretable without ambiguity\n\n### **Enhanced Clarity (Aspirational)**\n- E1: Task descriptions are concise and action-oriented\n- E2: Legend provided for non-standard status values\n- E3: Uses ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- E4: Visual cues (color coding, section headers) improve readability\n\n---\n\n✅ **This approach keeps it practical, avoids arbitrary limits, and focuses on real clarity issues.**\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to draft a scoring model for S20 (e.g., how to assign points for Core vs Enhanced) or a quick checklist template for evaluators?**",
