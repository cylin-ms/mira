      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP). We have Structural dimensions (S1-S20) that define WHAT should be in a WBP, and Grounding dimensions (G1-G8) that verify slot values against the source scenario.\n\nCurrent Grounding Dimensions:\n- G1: Hallucination Check - ENTITY, ATTENDEE, ARTIFACT must exist in scenario\n- G2: Attendee Grounding - OWNER must be from scenario attendee list\n- G3: Date/Time Grounding - DUE_DATE, DATE must be consistent with scenario timeline\n- G4: Artifact Grounding - ARTIFACT (input) must exist; DELIVERABLE must have spec\n- G5: Topic Grounding - TOPIC must align with scenario discussion points\n- G6: Action Item Grounding - TASK must trace to scenario ACTION_ITEM\n- G7: Context Preservation - preserve original scenario context\n- G8: Instruction Adherence - follow scenario instructions\n\nWe've added NEW slot types that need grounding rules:\n\n1. [GOAL] - The plan's objective/target outcome (e.g., 'Launch AI Search Feature')\n   - Question: Should GOAL be grounded to scenario, or is it implied/derived?\n\n2. [ASSUMPTION] - Condition believed true at planning time (e.g., 'budget approved by April 10')\n   - Question: Are assumptions scenario-grounded or planner-generated? Can planner invent reasonable assumptions?\n\n3. [BLOCKER] - Known obstacle (e.g., 'designer unavailable', 'budget approval delayed')\n   - Question: Must blockers come from scenario, or can planner identify reasonable blockers?\n\n4. [MITIGATION] - Action to address blocker (e.g., 'use backup designer')\n   - Question: Is mitigation grounded or free-form planner response?\n\n5. [SKILL] - Expertise required for task (e.g., 'design expertise', 'legal review')\n   - Question: Should skills be grounded to attendee capabilities from scenario?\n\n6. [ESCALATION_CONTACT] - Person with authority for escalation (e.g., 'VP Engineering')\n   - Question: Must this be an ATTENDEE, or can it be organizational hierarchy?\n\n7. [RESOURCE] - Non-people resource (e.g., 'budget approval', 'server access')\n   - Question: Should resources be grounded to scenario, or can planner identify reasonable resources?\n\n8. [UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD] - Time window when OWNER unavailable (e.g., 'April 20-25')\n   - Question: Must this come from scenario, or is it conditional input?\n\nFor each slot type, please recommend:\nA) GROUNDED: Must come from scenario (which G dimension?)\nB) DERIVED: Can be reasonably inferred from scenario context\nC) PLANNER-GENERATED: Planner can create reasonable values (no grounding penalty)\nD) CONDITIONAL: Only grounded if scenario provides the information\n\nAlso suggest if we need new G dimensions or can extend existing ones.",
      "answer": "Great questions! Let's go through each new slot type systematically and classify them as **GROUNDED**, **DERIVED**, **PLANNER-GENERATED**, or **CONDITIONAL**, and then determine whether new grounding dimensions are needed or if existing ones can be extended.\n\n---\n\n### **1. [GOAL] – The plan's objective/target outcome**\n- **Analysis:** The goal usually reflects the purpose of the scenario (e.g., \"Launch AI Search Feature\"). This is typically implied by the scenario description and should not contradict it.\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  **Classification:** **DERIVED** from scenario context (not verbatim, but must align).  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Extend **G5 (Topic Grounding)** to include GOAL alignment with scenario purpose.  \n  **No new G dimension needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **2. [ASSUMPTION] – Conditions believed true**\n- **Analysis:** Scenarios rarely list all assumptions; planners often add reasonable assumptions. However, if the scenario explicitly states assumptions, they must be preserved.\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  **Classification:** **CONDITIONAL**  \n  - If scenario provides assumptions → must ground (extend G7: Context Preservation).  \n  - If not provided → planner can generate reasonable assumptions (no penalty).  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Extend **G7** to check that provided assumptions are not contradicted.  \n  **No new G dimension needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **3. [BLOCKER] – Known obstacle**\n- **Analysis:** Scenarios may mention risks/blockers, but planners often identify additional plausible blockers.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  **Classification:** **CONDITIONAL**  \n  - If scenario lists blockers → must include and ground them.  \n  - Additional planner-generated blockers allowed if reasonable.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Extend **G7** (Context Preservation) to ensure scenario blockers are included.  \n  **No new G dimension needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **4. [MITIGATION] – Action to address blocker**\n- **Analysis:** Mitigation strategies are usually planner-generated responses to blockers.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  **Classification:** **PLANNER-GENERATED** (no grounding requirement, but should logically relate to blocker).  \n  **Grounding Rule:** No new dimension; optional consistency check with BLOCKER.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. [SKILL] – Expertise required**\n- **Analysis:** If scenario specifies attendee roles/skills, SKILL should align with them; otherwise, planner can infer.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  **Classification:** **CONDITIONAL**  \n  - If scenario provides attendee capabilities → SKILL must be consistent (extend G2: Attendee Grounding).  \n  - Otherwise, planner can generate reasonable skills.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Extend **G2** to cover SKILL alignment with attendee roles.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. [ESCALATION_CONTACT] – Person with authority**\n- **Analysis:** If scenario lists escalation contacts or hierarchy, must use them; otherwise, planner can invent reasonable roles.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  **Classification:** **CONDITIONAL**  \n  - If scenario provides escalation contact → must ground.  \n  - Otherwise, planner can specify plausible organizational role.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Extend **G2** (Attendee Grounding) to include escalation contacts.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. [RESOURCE] – Non-people resource**\n- **Analysis:** Scenarios may mention specific resources (budget, tools), but planners often add others.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  **Classification:** **CONDITIONAL**  \n  - If scenario lists resources → must ground.  \n  - Otherwise, planner can add reasonable resources.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Extend **G4 (Artifact Grounding)** to include RESOURCE grounding.  \n\n---\n\n### **8. [UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD] – Owner unavailable time**\n- **Analysis:** If scenario provides availability constraints, must ground; otherwise, planner can infer or leave blank.  \n- **Recommendation:**  \n  **Classification:** **CONDITIONAL**  \n  - If scenario specifies unavailability → must ground.  \n  - Otherwise, planner can generate plausible periods.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Extend **G3 (Date/Time Grounding)** to cover unavailability windows.  \n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Slot Type           | Classification    | Grounding Extension |\n|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| GOAL                | DERIVED          | Extend G5 (Topic)   |\n| ASSUMPTION          | CONDITIONAL      | Extend G7 (Context) |\n| BLOCKER             | CONDITIONAL      | Extend G7 (Context) |\n| MITIGATION          | PLANNER-GENERATED| None (logical link) |\n| SKILL               | CONDITIONAL      | Extend G2 (Attendee)|\n| ESCALATION_CONTACT  | CONDITIONAL      | Extend G2 (Attendee)|\n| RESOURCE            | CONDITIONAL      | Extend G4 (Artifact)|\n| UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD  | CONDITIONAL      | Extend G3 (Date)    |\n\n---\n\n### **Do we need new G dimensions?**\nNo **new dimensions** are strictly required. We can **extend existing G1–G8** as follows:\n- **G2** → Include SKILL and ESCALATION_CONTACT alignment with scenario roles.\n- **G3** → Include UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD consistency.\n- **G4** → Include RESOURCE grounding.\n- **G5** → Include GOAL alignment.\n- **G7** → Include ASSUMPTION and BLOCKER preservation.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Next Step:** Would you like me to **draft the updated G-dimension definitions (G1–G8 with these extensions)** and **propose a scoring rubric for these new slots**?",
