      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP). A WBP is a backward-scheduled project plan that works from a target completion date (T-0) back to the present, listing tasks, owners, due dates, deliverables, and dependencies.\n\nContext from our design principles:\n- Core WBP quality = completeness of tasks, logical sequencing/dependencies, accurate dates aligned to T-0, clear ownership\n- We distinguish between REQUIRED dimensions (core plan structure) vs ASPIRATIONAL dimensions (nice-to-have quality indicators)\n- We distinguish between PLANNING concerns (what tasks exist) vs OPERATIONAL/EXECUTION concerns (how to do tasks)\n- S20 (Clarity & First Impression) already checks that WBP tables have required columns including STATUS\n- We've marked several operational dimensions as N/A: Communication Plan, Feedback Integration, etc.\n\nQuestion about S15: Progress Tracking\nCurrent definition: 'Metrics and methods for tracking task completion'\nCurrent assertions:\n- S15_A1: 'Progress tracking must measure completion of each [TASK]'\n- S15_A2: 'Progress indicators (percentage, status) must be defined for each [TASK]' (e.g., 0%/50%/100% or Not Started/In Progress/Done)\n\nShould S15 (Progress Tracking) be:\n1. Kept as a separate dimension\n2. Merged into S20 (Clarity) since STATUS column is already checked there\n3. Marked as N/A (not applicable to WBP - operational/execution concern)\n\nConsider:\n- Is 'progress tracking' a structural element OF a WBP, or something you DO WITH a WBP?\n- Is specifying 'how to track progress' a planning concern or operational detail?\n- Does having a STATUS column (already in S20) cover the structural need?\n- Is S15_A1 ('track completion of each task') implicit/obvious rather than a quality differentiator?\n\nPlease provide your recommendation with reasoning.",
      "answer": "Great question—this gets to the heart of whether **progress tracking** is part of the *plan artifact* or part of *execution practice*. Let’s break it down systematically:\n\n---\n\n### **1. What is a WBP?**\nA Work-Back Plan is fundamentally a **planning artifact**: it defines tasks, sequencing, owners, and dates aligned to T‑0. Its primary purpose is to ensure the plan is complete and logically structured before execution begins.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Nature of S15 (Progress Tracking)**\n- **Current definition:** “Metrics and methods for tracking task completion.”\n- This implies *how progress will be monitored during execution* (e.g., % complete, status updates, dashboards).\n- This is **operational/execution-oriented**, not strictly part of the initial planning structure.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Compare with S20 (Clarity & First Impression)**\n- S20 already checks that the WBP table includes a **STATUS column**.\n- The STATUS column is a **structural placeholder** for progress updates, but:\n    - It does not require defining *methods or metrics* for tracking.\n    - It simply ensures the plan can accommodate progress information later.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Evaluate the assertions**\n- **S15_A1:** “Progress tracking must measure completion of each [TASK].”\n    - This is obvious—progress is inherently per-task. It doesn’t differentiate quality among WBPs.\n- **S15_A2:** “Progress indicators (percentage, status) must be defined for each [TASK].”\n    - If the STATUS column exists, this is already satisfied structurally.\n    - The actual *values* (e.g., 0%, In Progress) are filled during execution, not during planning.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Key questions**\n- Is “progress tracking” a **structural element of a WBP**?  \n    → Only to the extent that the plan includes a STATUS field (already in S20).\n- Is specifying “how to track progress” a **planning concern**?  \n    → No, that’s an operational detail.\n- Does S15 add meaningful differentiation beyond S20?  \n    → No, because the presence of STATUS is already checked.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**\n**Mark S15 as N/A for WBP quality evaluation.**  \nReasoning:\n- The essence of S15 (methods for tracking progress) belongs to *execution governance*, not the core planning artifact.\n- The only structural requirement (a STATUS column) is already enforced under S20.\n- Assertions like S15_A1 are implicit and do not provide additional quality signal.\n- Keeping S15 risks conflating planning quality with operational practice, which your design principles explicitly separate.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative if you want to retain some trace**\nIf you feel strongly about acknowledging progress tracking, you could:\n- Merge the STATUS column check fully into S20 and note that “WBP should include a placeholder for progress updates.”\n- Document S15 as “Out of Scope / Operational” in your framework for clarity.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Answer:**  \n**S15 should be marked N/A for WBP quality evaluation** (operational concern). The structural aspect (STATUS column) remains under S20. This keeps the framework clean and aligned with your principle of separating planning vs. execution.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **draft a short note explaining why S15 is N/A** for inclusion in your framework documentation?",
