      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP). \n\nQuestion about S17: Cross-team Coordination & Communication\nCurrent definition: 'Dependencies on other teams identified with contacts; communication methods specified for cross-team work'\nCurrent assertions:\n- S17_A1: 'Cross-team dependencies must identify the external team and contact [ATTENDEE]'\n- S17_A2: 'Cross-team [TASK] items must have explicit handoff dates'\n- S17_A3: 'For cross-team [TASK] items, communication method should be specified'\n\nProblems identified:\n1. Communication channel specification (S17_A3) is OPERATIONAL, not planning structure\n2. We cannot automatically detect if a WBP involves multiple teams - requires scenario input\n3. Even S17_A1/A2 assume we know which tasks are 'cross-team' - but how?\n\nContext:\n- S10 (Resource-Aware Planning) is CONDITIONAL - only applies if scenario provides resource constraints\n- We've marked operational dimensions as N/A: Communication Plan (S12 merged here), Feedback Integration (S14), Progress Tracking (S15)\n\nOptions:\n1. Mark S17 as N/A - cross-team coordination is operational/execution\n2. Mark S17 as CONDITIONAL - only applies if scenario explicitly identifies cross-team dependencies\n3. Keep S17 but remove S17_A3 (operational) and clarify it requires scenario input to identify cross-team tasks\n\nConsider:\n- Is 'identifying external team contacts' a structural planning element?\n- Is 'handoff dates for cross-team work' different from regular task dates (S5)?\n- Can we evaluate cross-team coordination without knowing which tasks are cross-team?\n\nPlease provide your recommendation with reasoning.",
      "answer": "Great question—this is a nuanced issue because **cross-team coordination** sits at the intersection of planning structure and operational execution. Let’s break it down systematically.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Concern**\n\n#### 1. **Is S17 fundamentally structural or operational?**\n- **Structural elements**: Identifying dependencies and incorporating them into the plan is a planning activity. If a WBP needs external teams to complete certain tasks, that should be reflected in the structure (tasks, dependencies, sequencing).\n- **Operational elements**: Specifying communication channels, escalation paths, or meeting cadence is operational—these are about *how* coordination happens during execution, not about the plan’s structure.\n\nSo, **S17_A3 (communication method)** is indeed operational and should be removed.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Can we detect cross-team involvement automatically?**\n- No, unless the scenario explicitly states which tasks involve other teams. Without scenario input, we cannot infer cross-team dependencies from the WBP alone.\n- This is similar to S10 (Resource-Aware Planning), which is CONDITIONAL based on scenario-provided constraints.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Are S17_A1 and S17_A2 structural?**\n- **S17_A1 (identify external team and contact)**: This is arguably structural because it clarifies ownership and responsibility for dependencies. It’s similar to assigning roles in a RACI matrix—part of planning.\n- **S17_A2 (handoff dates)**: If cross-team tasks exist, specifying handoff dates is part of sequencing and dependency management. While S5 covers task dates, S17_A2 ensures *dependency-specific clarity* (handoffs), which is slightly more granular but still structural.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Can we evaluate S17 without knowing cross-team tasks?**\n- No. We need scenario input to know which tasks are cross-team. Otherwise, we cannot apply these assertions.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation**\n\n**Option 3 is best, with adjustments:**\n- Keep S17 as a **CONDITIONAL structural dimension** (like S10).\n- Remove S17_A3 (operational).\n- Clarify that S17 applies **only if the scenario specifies cross-team dependencies**.\n- Assertions should focus on structural clarity, not operational details.\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Revised Definition and Assertions**\n\n**S17: Cross-team Coordination (CONDITIONAL)**  \n*Definition*: If the scenario involves multiple teams, the WBP should clearly represent cross-team dependencies and responsibilities.\n\n**Assertions:**\n- **S17_A1**: For each cross-team dependency, the external team and responsible contact must be identified.\n- **S17_A2**: For each cross-team dependency, handoff or dependency dates must be specified (beyond standard task dates if needed).\n\n*(Remove S17_A3 about communication methods.)*\n\n---\n\n### **Reasoning**\n- This keeps S17 focused on structural planning elements (dependencies, ownership, timing).\n- It aligns with the principle that operational aspects (communication plans, escalation) are out of scope for WBP structural quality.\n- It mirrors the approach for S10 (Resource-Aware Planning) as CONDITIONAL based on scenario context.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Recommendation:**  \n**Keep S17 as CONDITIONAL, remove operational assertion (S17_A3), and clarify that it applies only when the scenario specifies cross-team dependencies.**\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **draft the updated S17 section for your framework document** with the revised definition, assertions, and applicability note?",
