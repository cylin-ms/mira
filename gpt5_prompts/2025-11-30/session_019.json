      "answer": "Here’s an **optimized prompt** you can use to reliably decompose free-form assertions into atomic **S+G units** according to your framework:\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt Text**\n\nYou are an expert in requirements decomposition. Your task is to take a **free-form assertion** about a response and break it down into **atomic S+G units** using the given S (structural) and G (grounding) dimensions.\n\n---\n\n#### **INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n1. **Decompose the assertion into multiple atomic units**.  \n   - Each atomic unit corresponds to ONE structural requirement (S dimension) and its linked grounding checks (G dimensions).\n   - If the assertion contains multiple requirements, produce multiple atomic units.\n\n2. **If the assertion is purely grounding-related (no structural requirement),** still output an atomic unit with `\"s_dimension\": null` and `\"s_assertion\": null`.\n\n3. **Follow the S and G definitions and mappings strictly**:  \n   - **S DIMENSIONS (structural requirements):**  \n     - S1: Title - meeting/event title  \n     - S2: Timeline Alignment - time constraints, tight timeline  \n     - S3: Ownership Assignment - task owner  \n     - S4: Participant Identification - attendees, stakeholders  \n     - S5: Task Dates - when tasks happen  \n     - S6: Risk Assessment - risks, escalation  \n     - S8: Task Descriptions - what tasks involve  \n     - S9: Success Criteria - definition of done  \n     - S10: Buffer Time - contingency time  \n     - S16: Assumptions & Prerequisites - stated assumptions  \n     - S17: Dependencies - task dependencies  \n     - S18: Milestones - key checkpoints  \n     - S19: Communication Plan - sharing, notification  \n     - S20: Review & Approval - review cycles  \n\n   - **G DIMENSIONS (grounding checks):**  \n     - G1: Hallucination Prevention - no invented details  \n     - G2: Attendee Grounding - names match source  \n     - G3: Date/Time Grounding - dates match source  \n     - G4: Artifact Grounding - files match source  \n     - G5: Topic Grounding - topics match source  \n     - G6: Action Item Grounding - tasks match source  \n     - G7: Role Grounding - roles match source  \n     - G8: Constraint Grounding - limits match source  \n     - G9: Planner-Generated Consistency - generated content consistent  \n\n   - **S→G mappings:**  \n     - S1 → G5  \n     - S3 → G2, G6  \n     - S4 → G2, G7  \n     - S5 → G3  \n     - S16 → G5, G6, G9  \n     - S19 → G2, G4, G6  \n\n4. **For each atomic unit, output JSON with these fields:**  \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"s_dimension\": \"<S code or null>\",\n     \"s_name\": \"<S name or null>\",\n     \"s_assertion\": \"<short description of the structural requirement or null>\",\n     \"linked_g\": [\n       {\n         \"g_dimension\": \"<G code>\",\n         \"g_name\": \"<G name>\",\n         \"slot_value\": \"<value extracted from assertion>\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Extract slot values for each G dimension from the assertion text.**  \n   - Example: If the assertion says \"meeting '1:1 Action Items Review' is scheduled for July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST\", then:  \n     - For G5 (Topic), slot_value = `\"1:1 Action Items Review\"`  \n     - For G3 (Date/Time), slot_value = `\"July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST\"`\n\n6. **Return the final output as a clean JSON array of atomic units. No extra text.**\n\n---\n\n#### **EXAMPLE**\n\n**Input:**  \n```\nThe response should state that the meeting '1:1 Action Items Review' is scheduled for July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST.\n```\n\n**Output:**  \n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"s_dimension\": \"S1\",\n    \"s_name\": \"Title\",\n    \"s_assertion\": \"The response must state the meeting title\",\n    \"linked_g\": [\n      {\n        \"g_dimension\": \"G5\",\n        \"g_name\": \"Topic Grounding\",\n        \"slot_value\": \"1:1 Action Items Review\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"s_dimension\": \"S5\",\n    \"s_name\": \"Task Dates\",\n    \"s_assertion\": \"The response must state the meeting date/time\",\n    \"linked_g\": [\n      {\n        \"g_dimension\": \"G3\",\n        \"g_name\": \"Date/Time Grounding\",\n        \"slot_value\": \"July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **NOW YOUR TURN**\n\nDecompose the following assertion into atomic S+G units:  \n```\n{{ASSERTION_TEXT}}\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Why this works:\n- It gives **clear step-by-step rules** and **explicit mappings**.\n- It enforces **atomicity** (one S per unit).\n- It handles **pure grounding cases**.\n- It outputs **strict JSON** with no extra text.\n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to **also provide a few more worked examples** (including complex multi-constraint assertions and pure grounding cases) so you can test the prompt? Or should I **write a version optimized for GPT-4 or Claude with few-shot examples included**?",
