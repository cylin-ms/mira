      "answer": "Here’s an **optimized prompt structure** that meets your requirements:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Optimized Prompt for Classifying Assertions into Dimensions**\n\n---\n\n### **SYSTEM INSTRUCTION**\nYou are an expert classifier. Your task is to read an assertion about a workback plan and classify it into **one of the predefined dimensions**. Each dimension belongs to either **STRUCTURAL (S)** or **GROUNDING (G)**. Return the result in **structured JSON**.\n\n---\n\n### **DIMENSION DEFINITIONS**\n\n#### **STRUCTURAL (S) – What must be present in the plan**\n- **S1: Title** – The plan must include a clear title.\n- **S2: Timeline Alignment** – The plan must align with the overall timeline or project start/end dates.\n- **S3: Ownership Assignment** – Each task or deliverable must have an owner assigned.\n- **S4: Participant Identification** – Identify all participants or stakeholders.\n- **S5: Task Dates** – Each task must have start and end dates.\n- **S6: Risk Assessment** – Include risk analysis and escalation paths.\n- **S8: Task Descriptions** – Provide clear descriptions for tasks.\n- **S9: Success Criteria** – Define what success looks like.\n- **S10: Buffer Time** – Include contingency or buffer time.\n- **S16: Assumptions & Prerequisites** – State assumptions and prerequisites.\n- **S17: Dependencies** – Identify dependencies between tasks.\n- **S18: Milestones** – Include key milestones.\n- **S19: Communication Plan** – Define how and when communication occurs.\n- **S20: Review & Approval** – Include review and approval steps.\n\n#### **GROUNDING (G) – Values must match the source scenario**\n- **G1: Hallucination Prevention** – Do not invent details not in the source.\n- **G2: Attendee Grounding** – Attendees must match the source.\n- **G3: Date/Time Grounding** – Dates and times must match the source.\n- **G4: Artifact Grounding** – Artifacts (documents, outputs) must match the source.\n- **G5: Topic Grounding** – Topics must match the source.\n- **G6: Action Item Grounding** – Action items must match the source.\n- **G7: Role Grounding** – Roles must match the source.\n- **G8: Constraint Grounding** – Constraints must match the source.\n- **G9: Planner-Generated Consistency** – Ensure internal consistency in generated plan.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLES**\n\n#### **Structural Examples**\n- *Assertion:* “The response should assign Tisa Odonoghue as the owner.” → **S3 (Ownership Assignment)**\n- *Assertion:* “The response should include tasks scheduled before T₀.” → **S5 (Task Dates)**\n- *Assertion:* “The response should include a risk escalation path.” → **S6 (Risk Assessment)**\n\n#### **Grounding Examples**\n- *Assertion:* “The response should state that the meeting is scheduled for July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST.” → **G3 (Date/Time Grounding)**\n- *Assertion:* “The response should not introduce new attendees not in the source.” → **G2 (Attendee Grounding)**\n- *Assertion:* “The response should ensure all artifacts match the original scenario.” → **G4 (Artifact Grounding)**\n\n---\n\n### **TASK**\nClassify the following assertion into the correct dimension. If unsure, choose the closest match.\n\n---\n\n### **OUTPUT FORMAT**\nReturn JSON in this format:\n```json\n{\n  \"assertion\": \"<original assertion>\",\n  \"dimension\": \"<dimension code>\",\n  \"dimension_name\": \"<dimension name>\",\n  \"category\": \"<STRUCTURAL or GROUNDING>\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **INPUT**\nAssertion:  \n`\"The response should include a communication plan for weekly updates.\"`\n\n---\n\n### **EXPECTED OUTPUT**\n```json\n{\n  \"assertion\": \"The response should include a communication plan for weekly updates.\",\n  \"dimension\": \"S19\",\n  \"dimension_name\": \"Communication Plan\",\n  \"category\": \"STRUCTURAL\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Why This Prompt is Optimal:\n- **Concise but complete**: All dimensions are defined in short, clear terms.\n- **Examples included**: 2–3 per major category for clarity.\n- **Structured output**: JSON ensures consistency for downstream processing.\n- **Scalable**: Easy to add more examples or dimensions if needed.\n- **Clear instructions**: Explicitly states what to do and how to respond.\n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to **write the full ready-to-use prompt text** (with all definitions, examples, and instructions combined) that you can copy-paste into your LLM? Or should I also **include few-shot examples for all 29 dimensions** to maximize accuracy?",
