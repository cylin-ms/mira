      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP).\n\nWe have S20: Clarity & First Impression (Weight: 2, Extended)\nDefinition: 'UX-focused presentation for instant recognition and intuitive interaction'\n\nCurrent assertions:\n- S20_A1: WBP must contain [HEADER_ROW] with columns: Task, Owner, Deadline, Status\n- S20_A2: First 3 lines must include [GOAL_STATEMENT] summarizing objective\n- S20_A3: Each [TASK] description must be ≤12 words for scannability\n- S20_A4: All [DATE] values must use consistent YYYY-MM-DD format\n- S20_A5: [TASK] items must be in chronological order by [DUE_DATE]\n- S20_A6: No required cell (Task, Owner, Deadline, Status) may be empty\n- S20_A7: [OWNER] names must be spelled consistently throughout\n- S20_A8: If non-standard [STATUS] values used, a legend must be present\n\nReview questions:\n1. S20_A3 (≤12 words): Good threshold? Should be aspirational or required?\n2. S20_A4 (YYYY-MM-DD): Too prescriptive? Allow 'March 15, 2025'? Or just require 'consistent format'?\n3. S20_A5 (chronological order): Always desirable? What about grouping by workstream/owner?\n4. Any missing clarity assertions?\n5. Should S20 be REQUIRED (core) or Extended?\n\nConsider that S20 is about PRESENTATION/UX, not content correctness. Other dimensions handle content.",
      "answer": "Great questions! Let’s analyze each point systematically and provide recommendations.\n\n---\n\n### **Context Recap**\n- **S20: Clarity & First Impression** focuses on **presentation and UX**, not content correctness.\n- Weight: 2, currently marked as **Extended**.\n- Goal: Ensure a WBP is immediately understandable, scannable, and visually consistent.\n\n---\n\n## **Review of Questions**\n\n### **1. S20_A3 (≤12 words per task): Good threshold? Aspirational or required?**\n- **Rationale:** Short task descriptions improve scannability and reduce cognitive load.\n- **Threshold:** 12 words is reasonable (roughly one short sentence).\n    - Typical PM guidance: 5–10 words ideal, but 12 allows some flexibility.\n- **Aspirational vs Required:**\n    - If **required**, you risk penalizing legitimate cases (e.g., complex tasks).\n    - If **aspirational**, you encourage brevity without being rigid.\n- **Recommendation:**  \n    - Make it **Aspirational** (soft rule), but flag violations for review.\n    - Wording: “Prefer ≤12 words for clarity; longer descriptions should be exceptional.”\n\n---\n\n### **2. S20_A4 (YYYY-MM-DD): Too prescriptive?**\n- **Current:** Requires ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).\n- **Pros:**  \n    - Eliminates ambiguity (e.g., 03/04/25 could be March 4 or April 3).\n    - Machine-friendly.\n- **Cons:**  \n    - Some audiences prefer human-readable formats (e.g., “March 15, 2025”).\n- **Options:**  \n    - Require **consistency** rather than a specific format.\n    - Suggest ISO as best practice but allow alternatives if consistent.\n- **Recommendation:**  \n    - Assertion: “All [DATE] values must use a **consistent, unambiguous format** (ISO 8601 preferred).”\n    - Add note: “YYYY-MM-DD recommended for clarity and automation.”\n\n---\n\n### **3. S20_A5 (chronological order): Always desirable?**\n- **Current:** Requires tasks in chronological order by due date.\n- **Issue:**  \n    - Some WBPs group by workstream or owner for clarity.\n    - Chronological order may conflict with logical grouping.\n- **Recommendation:**  \n    - Adjust to: “Tasks must be organized in a **clear, predictable structure** (chronological or grouped by workstream/owner). The chosen structure must be stated or obvious.”\n    - This preserves UX intent without forcing one approach.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Any missing clarity assertions?**\nPossible gaps:\n- **Visual hierarchy:** Use of headings, section breaks, or indentation for readability.\n- **Legend for abbreviations:** If acronyms or shorthand are used, provide a legend.\n- **Consistent capitalization and punctuation:** For headers and task names.\n- **Avoid clutter:** No excessive formatting (e.g., random colors, merged cells).\n- **File naming clarity:** WBP filename should reflect project and version (optional).\n- **Accessibility:** Ensure color coding is not the sole indicator of status (color-blind friendly).\n\n**Proposed additions:**\n- **S20_A9:** If color is used to indicate status, provide a text label as well.\n- **S20_A10:** Use consistent capitalization and punctuation in headers and tasks.\n- **S20_A11:** Provide a legend for any abbreviations or custom codes.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Should S20 be REQUIRED (core) or Extended?**\n- **Argument for REQUIRED:**  \n    - First impression and clarity are critical for usability.\n    - If a WBP is confusing, it undermines its purpose even if content is correct.\n- **Argument for Extended:**  \n    - Some organizations prioritize content correctness over presentation.\n    - UX might be considered “nice-to-have” in minimal compliance scenarios.\n- **Recommendation:**  \n    - Make **S20 REQUIRED** (core), because clarity is foundational to effective execution.\n    - Weight can remain moderate (2), but failing S20 should block approval.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Recommendations**\n- **S20_A3:** Keep as **aspirational** (≤12 words), not hard fail.\n- **S20_A4:** Require **consistent, unambiguous date format**; recommend ISO.\n- **S20_A5:** Allow chronological OR grouped by workstream/owner; must be clear.\n- **Additions:** Visual hierarchy, legends for abbreviations, color-blind accessibility, consistent capitalization.\n- **S20 Status:** Make REQUIRED (core), weight = 2.\n\n---\n\n✅ Would you like me to **draft a revised S20 section with updated assertions and notes** based on these recommendations?",
