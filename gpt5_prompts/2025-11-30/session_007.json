      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP). We have Structural dimensions (S1-S20) that define WHAT should be in a WBP, and Grounding dimensions (G1-G8) that verify slot values against the source scenario.\n\nCurrent Grounding Dimensions:\n- G1: Hallucination Check - ENTITY, ATTENDEE, ARTIFACT must exist in scenario\n- G2: Attendee Grounding - OWNER must be from scenario attendee list\n- G3: Date/Time Grounding - DUE_DATE, DATE must be consistent with scenario timeline\n- G4: Artifact Grounding - ARTIFACT (input) must exist; DELIVERABLE must have spec\n- G5: Topic Grounding - TOPIC must align with scenario discussion points\n- G6: Action Item Grounding - TASK must trace to scenario ACTION_ITEM\n- G7: Context Preservation - preserve original scenario context\n- G8: Instruction Adherence - follow scenario instructions\n\nWe've added NEW slot types that need grounding rules:\n\n1. [GOAL] - The plan's objective/target outcome (e.g., 'Launch AI Search Feature')\n2. [ASSUMPTION] - Condition believed true at planning time (e.g., 'budget approved by April 10')\n3. [BLOCKER] - Known obstacle (e.g., 'designer unavailable', 'budget approval delayed')\n4. [MITIGATION] - Action to address blocker (e.g., 'use backup designer')\n5. [SKILL] - Expertise required for task (e.g., 'design expertise', 'legal review')\n6. [ESCALATION_CONTACT] - Person with authority for escalation (e.g., 'VP Engineering')\n7. [RESOURCE] - Non-people resource (e.g., 'budget approval', 'server access')\n8. [UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD] - Time window when OWNER unavailable (e.g., 'April 20-25')\n\nFor each slot type, classify as:\nA) GROUNDED: Must come from scenario (specify which G dimension)\nB) DERIVED: Can be reasonably inferred from scenario context\nC) PLANNER-GENERATED: Planner can create reasonable values (no grounding penalty)\nD) CONDITIONAL: Only grounded if scenario provides the information\n\nConsider:\n- What's the grounding source for each? (scenario text, planner judgment, external input)\n- Should we penalize a planner for inventing reasonable blockers/assumptions?\n- How do we verify planner-generated content without being too restrictive?\n\nAlso recommend: Do we need new G dimensions, or extend existing G1-G8?",
      "answer": "Great question! Let’s break this down systematically.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Analyze Each New Slot Type**\n\nWe’ll classify each slot as **GROUNDED**, **DERIVED**, **PLANNER-GENERATED**, or **CONDITIONAL**, and specify grounding logic.\n\n---\n\n### **1. [GOAL]**\n- **Nature:** The WBP’s objective should reflect the scenario’s stated purpose or deliverable.\n- **Grounding Source:** Scenario usually states the project goal explicitly or implicitly.\n- **Classification:**  \n  ✅ **GROUNDED** — Must align with scenario’s stated objective.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Extend **G5 (Topic Grounding)** or create **G9: Goal Grounding** to check that GOAL matches scenario purpose/deliverable.\n\n---\n\n### **2. [ASSUMPTION]**\n- **Nature:** Assumptions often fill gaps in planning; scenario rarely lists all assumptions.\n- **Grounding Source:** Some assumptions may be explicitly stated (e.g., “budget approval expected by April 10”).\n- **Classification:**  \n  ✅ **CONDITIONAL** — If scenario states an assumption, it must match. Otherwise, planner can add reasonable assumptions without penalty.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** If present in scenario, enforce grounding; else allow planner-generated.\n\n---\n\n### **3. [BLOCKER]**\n- **Nature:** Known obstacles; scenario might mention some, but planners often anticipate others.\n- **Grounding Source:** Scenario may list risks or blockers, but not all.\n- **Classification:**  \n  ✅ **CONDITIONAL** — Ground if scenario mentions blockers; otherwise, planner can add reasonable blockers.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** If scenario specifies blockers, they must appear; extra blockers allowed.\n\n---\n\n### **4. [MITIGATION]**\n- **Nature:** Actions to address blockers; usually planner-generated.\n- **Grounding Source:** Rarely in scenario.\n- **Classification:**  \n  ✅ **PLANNER-GENERATED** — No grounding penalty; evaluate for plausibility, not scenario match.\n\n---\n\n### **5. [SKILL]**\n- **Nature:** Required expertise; scenario may hint at roles or tasks.\n- **Grounding Source:** Derived from tasks/attendees in scenario.\n- **Classification:**  \n  ✅ **DERIVED** — Should be inferable from scenario tasks or roles.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Check if skill logically maps to scenario roles or deliverables.\n\n---\n\n### **6. [ESCALATION_CONTACT]**\n- **Nature:** Person with authority; scenario may list stakeholders.\n- **Grounding Source:** Scenario attendee list or escalation instructions.\n- **Classification:**  \n  ✅ **CONDITIONAL** — If scenario names escalation contact, must match; otherwise planner can choose from scenario attendees with seniority.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Must be from scenario attendee list if specified.\n\n---\n\n### **7. [RESOURCE]**\n- **Nature:** Non-people resources; scenario may mention some (budget, tools).\n- **Grounding Source:** Scenario text.\n- **Classification:**  \n  ✅ **CONDITIONAL** — If scenario lists resources, must match; else planner can add reasonable ones.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Validate scenario-provided resources; extra allowed.\n\n---\n\n### **8. [UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD]**\n- **Nature:** Time when OWNER is unavailable; scenario may mention vacations or conflicts.\n- **Grounding Source:** Scenario text.\n- **Classification:**  \n  ✅ **CONDITIONAL** — If scenario specifies unavailability, must match; otherwise planner can add if reasonable.  \n  **Grounding Rule:** Enforce only if scenario provides info.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Slot Type           | Classification     | Grounding Basis                          |\n|---------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| GOAL               | GROUNDED          | Scenario objective (extend G5 or new G9)|\n| ASSUMPTION         | CONDITIONAL       | Match scenario if stated; else free     |\n| BLOCKER            | CONDITIONAL       | Match scenario if stated; else free     |\n| MITIGATION         | PLANNER-GENERATED | No grounding; check plausibility        |\n| SKILL              | DERIVED           | Infer from scenario roles/tasks         |\n| ESCALATION_CONTACT | CONDITIONAL       | From scenario attendees if specified    |\n| RESOURCE           | CONDITIONAL       | Match scenario if stated; else free     |\n| UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD | CONDITIONAL       | Match scenario if stated; else free     |\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Grounding Dimensions – Do We Need New Ones?**\n\nCurrent G1–G8 mostly cover entities, attendees, dates, artifacts, topics, and instructions. For new slots:\n\n- **GOAL**: Needs explicit grounding → **Add G9: Goal Grounding**  \n  *“GOAL must align with scenario’s stated objective or deliverable.”*\n\n- **ASSUMPTION/BLOCKER/RESOURCE/UNAVAILABLE_PERIOD**: Conditional grounding → Extend **G7 (Context Preservation)** to include “If scenario provides explicit assumptions, blockers, resources, or availability constraints, they must be preserved.”\n\n- **SKILL**: Could extend **G6 (Action Item Grounding)** or add **G10: Skill Derivation Check**  \n  *“Skills should logically derive from scenario roles/tasks.”*\n\n- **ESCALATION_CONTACT**: Could extend **G2 (Attendee Grounding)** to cover escalation contacts.\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Extensions**\n- **G9: Goal Grounding**  \n- **G10: Skill Derivation Check**  \n- Extend **G2** for escalation contacts  \n- Extend **G7** for conditional slots (assumptions, blockers, resources, availability)\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Should We Penalize Planner for Inventing Reasonable Blockers/Assumptions?**\n**No** — as long as:\n- They don’t contradict scenario facts.\n- They’re plausible given scenario context.\n\nThis encourages proactive planning without hallucination penalties.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: How to Verify Planner-Generated Content Without Being Too Restrictive?**\n- Use **soft checks**:  \n  - Validate plausibility (e.g., blockers relevant to tasks, assumptions not contradicting scenario).\n  - No strict grounding requirement unless scenario explicitly states the value.\n- Mark these as **“contextually reasonable”** rather than “grounded.”\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Final Recommendations**\n1. **Add G9 (Goal Grounding)** and G10 (Skill Derivation Check).  \n2. Extend G2 and G7 for conditional slots.  \n3. Use **conditional grounding** for assumptions, blockers, resources, unavailability.  \n4. Do **not penalize** reasonable planner-generated content if scenario is silent.  \n5. For evaluation, distinguish between:  \n   - **Hard grounding errors** (contradictions, ignoring explicit scenario facts).  \n   - **Soft plausibility checks** (reasonable additions).\n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to **draft the updated Grounding Dimension list (G1–G10 with new rules)** and **a scoring approach for conditional slots**?",
