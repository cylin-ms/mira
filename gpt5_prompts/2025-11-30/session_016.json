      "question": "I need to optimize a prompt for Information Extraction (IE) from workback plan assertions. After classifying an assertion into a dimension (S1-S20 or G1-G9), I need to extract slot values for linked G dimensions.\n\nFor example:\n- S3 (Ownership) links to G2 (Attendee Grounding) - extract person names\n- S5 (Task Dates) links to G3 (Date/Time Grounding) - extract dates/times\n- S4 (Participants) links to G2, G7 - extract attendees and roles\n\nSlot types I need to extract:\n- G2: Person names (e.g., 'Tisa Odonoghue', 'John Smith')\n- G3: Dates/times (e.g., 'July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST', 'before T₀')\n- G4: Artifacts (e.g., 'Report.xlsx', 'config-standards.docx')\n- G5: Topics (e.g., 'budget review', 'quarterly planning')\n- G6: Action items (e.g., 'confirm agenda', 'distribute pre-reads')\n- G7: Roles (e.g., 'meeting organizer', 'technical lead')\n- G8: Constraints (e.g., 'max 30 minutes', 'must complete by EOD')\n- G9: Planner-generated content (e.g., assumptions, blockers)\n\nDesign an optimized IE prompt that:\n1. Extracts EXACT values as written (preserve formatting)\n2. Returns null for slots not mentioned\n3. Handles multiple values per slot type\n4. Is robust to different phrasings\n\nPropose the optimal IE prompt structure.",
      "answer": "Here’s an **optimized Information Extraction (IE) prompt structure** tailored for your use case:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Prompt Structure**\n\n**System Instruction:**\n```\nYou are an expert information extraction system. Your task is to extract specific slot values from a given assertion based on its classified dimension and linked G-dimensions. Follow these rules strictly:\n\n1. Extract EXACT text spans from the assertion (preserve original formatting, spelling, and punctuation).\n2. If a slot type is not mentioned, return null.\n3. If multiple values exist for a slot type, return them as a list in the order they appear.\n4. Do not infer or rephrase values; only copy what is explicitly stated.\n5. Be robust to varied phrasing and sentence structures.\n6. Output in strict JSON format with keys for each relevant G-dimension.\n```\n\n---\n\n**User Prompt Template:**\n```\nAssertion: \"{ASSERTION_TEXT}\"\nClassified Dimension: {S_DIMENSION}\nLinked G-Dimensions: {LIST_OF_G_DIMENSIONS}\n\nExtract slot values for the linked G-dimensions from the assertion text.\n\nSlot Types:\n- G2: Person names\n- G3: Dates/times\n- G4: Artifacts\n- G5: Topics\n- G6: Action items\n- G7: Roles\n- G8: Constraints\n- G9: Planner-generated content\n\nReturn the result as JSON with one key per linked G-dimension. Each key should map to:\n- null if no value is found\n- a list of exact text spans if values are found\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Example Prompt with Input**\n```\nAssertion: \"Tisa Odonoghue and John Smith will finalize the budget review report by July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST.\"\nClassified Dimension: S5 (Task Dates)\nLinked G-Dimensions: G2, G3, G5\n\nExtract slot values for the linked G-dimensions from the assertion text.\n\nSlot Types:\n- G2: Person names\n- G3: Dates/times\n- G5: Topics\n\nReturn the result as JSON.\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Expected Output**\n```json\n{\n  \"G2\": [\"Tisa Odonoghue\", \"John Smith\"],\n  \"G3\": [\"July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST\"],\n  \"G5\": [\"budget review\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Why This Structure Works**\n- **Explicit instructions**: Forces exact text extraction and null handling.\n- **Dimension-driven**: Uses classified dimension and linked G-dimensions to scope extraction.\n- **JSON output**: Ensures structured, machine-readable results.\n- **Scalable**: Works for any combination of G-dimensions.\n- **Robustness**: Handles multiple values and varied phrasing by focusing on explicit mentions.\n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to **also include few-shot examples** (covering multiple S→G mappings and edge cases like missing slots, multiple values, and unusual phrasing) to make the prompt even more robust? Or should I **design a single universal prompt template that includes instructions + examples for zero-shot use**?",
