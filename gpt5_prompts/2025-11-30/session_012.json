      "question": "We are designing a quality evaluation framework for Work-Back Plans (WBP).\n\nWe have S20: Clarity & First Impression (Weight: 2, Extended)\nDefinition: 'UX-focused presentation for instant recognition and intuitive interaction'\n\nCurrent assertions:\n- S20_A1: WBP must contain [HEADER_ROW] with columns: Task, Owner, Deadline, Status\n- S20_A2: First 3 lines must include [GOAL_STATEMENT] summarizing objective\n- S20_A3: Each [TASK] description must be ≤12 words for scannability\n- S20_A4: All [DATE] values must use consistent YYYY-MM-DD format\n- S20_A5: [TASK] items must be in chronological order by [DUE_DATE]\n- S20_A6: No required cell (Task, Owner, Deadline, Status) may be empty\n- S20_A7: [OWNER] names must be spelled consistently throughout\n- S20_A8: If non-standard [STATUS] values used, a legend must be present\n\nQuestions for review:\n\n1. Is '≤12 words' (S20_A3) a good threshold for task conciseness? Should this be aspirational or required?\n\n2. Is 'YYYY-MM-DD' format (S20_A4) too prescriptive? What about human-readable formats like 'March 15, 2025' or 'Mar 15'? Should we require 'consistent format' rather than a specific format?\n\n3. Should S20 be marked as REQUIRED (core structural requirement for readability) or keep as Extended?\n\n4. Are there any missing clarity assertions we should add?\n\n5. S20_A5 (chronological order) - is this always desirable? What about grouping by workstream or owner?\n\nContext:\n- S20 is about basic readability and usability of a WBP\n- Other S dimensions cover content (tasks, owners, dates, dependencies)\n- S20 focuses on PRESENTATION of that content\n\nPlease review and provide recommendations for any adjustments.",
      "answer": "Great questions! Let’s review each point systematically and make recommendations based on best practices for clarity, usability, and flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Is '≤12 words' (S20_A3) a good threshold for task conciseness? Should this be aspirational or required?**\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The intent is to keep tasks scannable and avoid long, paragraph-like descriptions.\n- 12 words is a reasonable heuristic (roughly one short sentence).\n- However, some tasks may require slightly more detail for clarity.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Make this **aspirational, not strictly required**.\n- Phrase as:  \n  *\"Each [TASK] description should be concise (ideally ≤12 words) for quick scanning.\"*\n- Optionally, allow a tolerance (e.g., flag but don’t fail if >12 words).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Is 'YYYY-MM-DD' format (S20_A4) too prescriptive? Should we require 'consistent format' rather than a specific format?**\n\n**Analysis:**\n- ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) is excellent for machine-readability and sorting.\n- However, WBPs are often human-facing, and formats like “Mar 15, 2025” are more intuitive for some audiences.\n- The key is **consistency** and **unambiguous dates**.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Change assertion to:  \n  *\"All [DATE] values must use a consistent and unambiguous format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD or 'Mar 15, 2025').\"*\n- Optionally, allow configuration of preferred format per organization.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Should S20 be marked as REQUIRED (core structural requirement for readability) or keep as Extended?**\n\n**Analysis:**\n- S20 addresses **presentation and clarity**, which is foundational for usability.\n- Without clarity, even correct content is hard to consume.\n- However, some organizations may prioritize content correctness over presentation.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Mark S20 as **Required for any WBP intended for stakeholder review**.\n- If the framework supports tiers, classify as **Tier 1 (Core Readability)**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Are there any missing clarity assertions we should add?**\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- **S20_A9: Avoid abbreviations or acronyms without explanation** (first use should define them).\n- **S20_A10: Ensure visual separation of sections (e.g., header row visually distinct)**.\n- **S20_A11: Provide a clear title and version/date of the WBP** (helps with context).\n- **S20_A12: If color coding is used, ensure it is accompanied by text labels** (for accessibility).\n\n---\n\n### **5. S20_A5 (chronological order) - is this always desirable? What about grouping by workstream or owner?**\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Chronological order is intuitive for execution-focused readers.\n- However, grouping by workstream or owner is common for planning and accountability.\n- For clarity, the key is **predictable and declared ordering**.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Revise to:  \n  *\"Tasks must follow a clear and declared ordering (e.g., chronological, by workstream, or by owner). If not chronological, the grouping logic must be evident.\"*\n\n---\n\n## **Proposed Revised S20 Assertions**\n\n- **S20_A1:** WBP must contain [HEADER_ROW] with columns: Task, Owner, Deadline, Status.\n- **S20_A2:** First 3 lines must include [GOAL_STATEMENT] summarizing objective.\n- **S20_A3:** Each [TASK] description should be concise (ideally ≤12 words).\n- **S20_A4:** All [DATE] values must use a consistent and unambiguous format.\n- **S20_A5:** Tasks must follow a clear and declared ordering (chronological or grouped).\n- **S20_A6:** No required cell (Task, Owner, Deadline, Status) may be empty.\n- **S20_A7:** [OWNER] names must be spelled consistently throughout.\n- **S20_A8:** If non-standard [STATUS] values used, a legend must be present.\n- **S20_A9:** Avoid unexplained abbreviations or acronyms.\n- **S20_A10:** Ensure visual separation of header and sections for readability.\n- **S20_A11:** Include WBP title and version/date.\n- **S20_A12:** If color coding is used, provide text labels for accessibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Key Changes**\n- Make task length aspirational, not mandatory.\n- Require consistent date format, not a specific one.\n- Make S20 Required for stakeholder-facing WBPs.\n- Add new assertions for acronyms, header clarity, title/version, and accessibility.\n- Relax chronological order to allow alternative logical groupings.\n\n---\n\n✅ Would you like me to **draft a scoring rubric for S20** (e.g., how to evaluate compliance and assign points)? Or **create an updated framework table with weights and scoring logic**?",
