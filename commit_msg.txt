[Copilot] Add G10: Relation Grounding dimension

New Features:
- Added G10 (Relation Grounding) as new dimension for verifying relationships
  between entities (DEPENDS_ON, BLOCKS, OWNS, PRODUCES, REQUIRES_INPUT)
- Updated S_TO_G_MAP: S2, S3, S6, S17 now include G10
- Added RELATION_TYPES to dimensions.py with 5 relation types
- Updated prompts.json to v2.3 with G10 guidance in all prompts
- Added G9/G10 to analyzer.py DIMENSION_SPEC (was missing)

Documentation:
- Updated WBP_Evaluation_Complete_Dimension_Reference.md with G10 section
- Added Relation Types Reference section with formal definitions
- Updated G Dimension Interdependencies table with G10

Testing:
- Tested analyzer with dependency assertion - G10 now being selected!
- Result: S2 + G6 + G10 (3 assertions, 3 passed)

GPT-5 Consultation (sessions 021-023):
- Asked GPT-5 3x whether to add G10 or fold into G6
- Unanimous recommendation: Add G10 as separate dimension
- Reasoning: Entity grounding != Relation grounding

Key Insight: Entity grounding (G1-G9) checks individual entities exist.
Relation grounding (G10) checks RELATIONSHIPS between entities are grounded.
A WBP can have valid tasks (G6 passes) but wrong dependencies (G10 fails).
