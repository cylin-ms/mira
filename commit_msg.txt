Full Pipeline (5 steps, 5 GPT-5 calls):

2. S+G Generation (generate_sg_assertions + select_relevant_g_dimensions)
3. Scenario Generation (generate_scenario_for_assertion)
4. WBP Generation (generate_wbp_with_scenario)
5. Verification (verify_wbp_against_scenario)

Test Results:
- Single assertion: PASS
- Batch (5 assertions): 5/5 PASS (100%)
