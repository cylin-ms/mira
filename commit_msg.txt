[Copilot] Establish S->G->M three-layer framework (GPT-5 consensus)

FRAMEWORK DESIGN:
- S (Structural, S1-S20): Check IF something exists - INDEPENDENT
- G (Grounding, G2-G10): Check if VALUE matches source - INDEPENDENT
- M (Meta, M1): No Hallucination - DERIVED from all G results

KEY CHANGES:
1. dimensions.py:
   - G1 deprecated ('DEPRECATED - See M1')
   - M1 added ('No Hallucination')
   - GROUNDING_PRIORITY_ORDER: removed G1, added G10
   - META_LAYER_ORDER: ['M1'] (new)
   - SLOT_TYPES: removed G1 references, ENTITY -> M1
   - Added G Assertion Independence documentation
   - Updated docstring with Three-Layer Framework section

2. WBP_Evaluation_Complete_Dimension_Reference.md:
   - Added Three-Layer Framework section with layer definitions
   - Added Key Design Principles (4 principles)
   - Added Evaluation Workflow diagram

3. copilot-instructions.md:
   - Added S->G->M Three-Layer Framework lesson
   - Added 'Python is already installed' lesson
   - Updated scratchpad with completed tasks

DESIGN RATIONALE (from GPT-5 consultation, 3 runs):
- S and G assertions are INDEPENDENT (directly observable)
- Hallucination checks ABSENCE of unsupported content
- Hallucination requires ALL G results -> DERIVED property
- G10 is INDEPENDENT (checks if relation exists, not if args correct)

GPT-5 Consensus: Move G1 to separate Meta layer as M1
