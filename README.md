- **Mira Annotation Tool**: Interactive Streamlit UI to explore, annotate, and evaluate assertion quality
- **Entity Card Rendering**: Rich display for Chat, Email, File, User, and ChannelMessage entities
- **Offline Matching**: Find evidence in responses that supports specific assertions

### Data Pipeline

The dataset flows through the following pipeline:

1. **Meeting Context Data** (by Weiwei Cui)
   - LOD (LiveOak Data) files containing meeting entities: Events, Files, Emails, Chats, Users
   - Utterances representing user requests for workback plans
   - See [DATA_GENERATION.md](docs/DATA_GENERATION.md) for details

2. **Workback Plan Generation** (by Kening Ren)
   - LLM-generated responses to user utterances
   - Assertions with justification and sourceID linking to specific entities
   - 103 meetings with 1,395 total assertions

3. **Assertion Evaluation** (by Chin-Yew Lin)
   - GPT-5 JJ automated evaluation with 96.2% pass rate
   - Supporting span extraction with confidence scores
   - Mira annotation tool for human review

The methodology for deriving assertions is documented in [deriving_assertions_workback_plan.md](docs/deriving_assertions_workback_plan.md) by Weiwei Cui.

## GPT-5 JJ Automated Evaluation

Mira integrates with GPT-5 JJ (via Microsoft Substrate API) for automated assertion evaluation.

### How It Works

For each assertion, GPT-5 JJ:
1. **Evaluates** whether the response satisfies the assertion (PASS/FAIL)
2. **Extracts** supporting text spans from the response
3. **Assigns** confidence scores (0.0-1.0) to each span
4. **Identifies** which response section contains each span
5. **Provides** reasoning for the evaluation

### Running GPT-5 Evaluation

```powershell
# Evaluate all meetings (resume from checkpoint)
python evaluate_assertions_gpt5.py

# Evaluate specific range
python evaluate_assertions_gpt5.py --start 0 --end 103

# Evaluate single meeting by index (0-based)
python evaluate_assertions_gpt5.py --meeting 5

# Evaluate by UI meeting number (1-based)
python evaluate_assertions_gpt5.py --meeting-num 7

# Force reprocess all meetings
python evaluate_assertions_gpt5.py --force
```

### Evaluation Results

Results are saved to `docs/assertion_scores.json`:

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Viewing Results in Mira

1. **Header Icons**: Each assertion shows ✅ (passed) or ❌ (failed) in the expander header
2. **Evaluation Section**: Expand an assertion to see the full GPT-5 evaluation
3. **Supporting Evidence**: Color-coded boxes show extracted spans
   - 🟢 Green = supports the assertion (confidence-based intensity)
   - 🔴 Red = contradicts the assertion
4. **Confidence Bars**: Visual progress bars show span confidence
5. **Section Attribution**: Each span shows which response section it came from
6. **Verification**: Check/uncheck boxes to accept/reject GPT-5's explanations

### Rate Limiting

The evaluation script includes built-in rate limiting:
- 1 second between assertions
- 3 seconds between meetings
- 10 seconds between batches (10 meetings/batch)

## Entity Card Rendering

Mira provides rich card rendering for different entity types found in the meeting context.

### Chat Entity Cards 💬

Displays chat conversations with a two-column layout:

| Left Column | Right Column |
|-------------|--------------|
| Chat metadata (ID, topic) | Message bubbles |
| Member count | Sender, content, timestamp |

Each message is rendered as a styled bubble with:
- 👤 Sender name in blue
- Message content
- Timestamp aligned right

### Email Entity Cards ✉️

Displays email with metadata and body preview:

| Left Column | Right Column |
|-------------|--------------|
| Subject, From, Date | Email body |
| To/Cc recipients | Rendered content |

### File Entity Cards 📄

Displays document files with content preview:

| Left Column | Right Column |
|-------------|--------------|
| File name, type, size | Content tabs |
| Metadata table | 📄 Preview / ℹ️ Raw Source |

### User Entity Cards 👤

Displays user information with avatar:

- Visual avatar with initials
- Display name and user ID
- Mail nickname
- 🔗 Azure Key Vault link for Test Tenant access

### ChannelMessage Cards 📢

Displays Teams channel messages:

| Left Column | Right Column |
|-------------|--------------|
| Message info | Content |
| Sender, timestamp | Full message body |

### Generic Entity Card

For any entity type with a `Content` or `Body` field, automatically displays the content.

## Annotation Workflow

This section describes the complete annotation workflow using Mira.

### Step 1: Launch Mira and Set Up

```bash
streamlit run mira.py
```

1. **Enter Your Name**: Type your name in the "👤 Judge" field
2. **Select Filter** (optional): Use "🔍 Filter" to focus on specific meeting types
3. **Select a Meeting**: Click on a meeting in the sidebar (📕 = Not Started)

### Step 2: Review Meeting Context (Important!)

> **📋 Note:** The Meeting Context section contains all the source data that was used to generate the assertions. Reviewing this context is essential for accurate annotation.

1. **Notice the Banner**: A prominent blue banner "📋 Meeting Context Available" alerts you to the available context
2. **Expand Meeting Context**: Click "📥 View Meeting Context (Entities, Organizer, Source Data)"
3. **Review Meeting Organizer**: 
   - See the organizer's name, ID, and avatar
   - Click the name to access Azure Key Vault credentials (for Test Tenant login)
4. **Browse Entity Cards**: These are the source entities referenced by assertions
   - 📅 **Event cards**: Meeting details, attendees, time/location
   - 💬 **Chat cards**: Message history displayed as styled bubbles
   - ✉️ **Email cards**: Subject, recipients, and full body preview
   - 📄 **File cards**: Document content with Preview/Raw tabs
   - 👤 **User cards**: User info with Azure Key Vault link
5. **Check SourceID Links**: When you click "🔗 View Entity" on an assertion, it will:
   - Auto-expand the Meeting Context section
   - Highlight the linked entity with a green banner
   - Help you verify if the assertion is correctly grounded

### Step 3: Review GPT-5 Evaluation

Before making manual judgments, review the automated evaluation:

1. **Check Header Icons**: Look for ✅ (passed) or ❌ (failed) in assertion headers
2. **Expand an Assertion**: Click to see full GPT-5 evaluation
3. **Review Evidence**: Check the color-coded supporting spans
4. **Verify or Reject**: Uncheck boxes if you disagree with GPT-5's findings

### Step 4: Annotate the Response

1. **Read Section Content**: Review each section of the LLM response
2. **Add Section Annotations**: Click "📝 Add annotation for this section"
3. **Add Overall Comment**: Use "📋 Overall Response Annotation" at the bottom

### Step 5: Evaluate Each Assertion

1. **Expand the Assertion**: Click to see full details
2. **Review GPT-5 Evaluation**: Check PASS/FAIL status and evidence
3. **Verify Evidence**: Accept or reject GPT-5's supporting spans
4. **Check Correctness**: Toggle "✅ This assertion is correct"
5. **Set Confidence**: Check "🎯 Confident in judgment" if you're sure
6. **Mark as Judged**: Check "📋 Judged" when done
7. **Add Notes/Revision** (optional): Explain issues or suggest improvements

### Step 6: Track Progress & Export

- **Progress Bar**: Shows completion percentage
- **Status Indicators**: 📗 Complete | 📙 Partial | 📕 Not Started
- **Auto-Save**: Annotations save to `docs/annotations_temp.json`
- **Export**: Click "📤 Export" to create `docs/annotated_output.jsonl`

### Annotation Data Saved

For each assertion, the following data is captured:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `is_good` | Whether the assertion is correct (true/false) |
| `is_confident` | Whether you're confident in your judgment |
| `is_judged` | Whether the assertion has been reviewed |
| `note` | Optional explanation or comments |
| `revision` | Optional suggested improvement |
| `gpt5_verification` | GPT-5 explanation/span verification status |

### Best Practices

1. **Judge all assertions** in a meeting to mark it as "Fully Judged"
2. **Use the filter** to find meetings that need attention
3. **Save frequently** - click "💾 Save" or wait for auto-save
4. **Export before closing** - click "📤 Export"
5. **Add notes** for incorrect assertions to explain why they fail
6. **Verify GPT-5 results** - the AI isn't always right!
