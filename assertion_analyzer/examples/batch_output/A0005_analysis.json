All teams have access to the shared Confluence space and shared drive.  \n   *Impact if invalidated*: Delays in uploading and accessing deliverables.\n2. No major scope changes will occur after March 20.  \n   *Impact if invalidated*: Rework and potential timeline slippage.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n- All deliverables must be stored in Confluence with version control.\n- Adherence to agreed formats (UX: Sketch, Engineering: Excel, Marketing: Word) is mandatory.\n",
