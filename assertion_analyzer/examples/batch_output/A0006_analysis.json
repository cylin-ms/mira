No major scope changes after design freeze on April 15\n   - *Impact if invalidated:* Additional design and development cycles, delaying launch\n\n---\n\n## Referenced Artifacts\n- Q3_Launch_ProjectPlan_v2.docx\n- FeatureScope_Q3.pdf\n- MarketingCampaignOutline.xlsx\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n- Action items trace to meeting discussion:\n  - Included bi-weekly progress review checkpoints (from discussion on structured reviews)\n  - Set up recurring invites starting April 1\n  - Assign Linda Chen to maintain status dashboard\n",
