All team members have access to the shared drive for uploading deliverables.\n   - **Impact if invalidated**: Delays in handoff and missed deadlines.\n2. No major changes to brand guidelines will occur before campaign launch.\n   - **Impact if invalidated**: Rework of creative assets and potential timeline shifts.\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n- Are there any contingency plans if the video vendor experiences delays?\n- Will QA review be needed for the email template before Jan 25?\n",
