Vendor integration will be completed by end of April. **Impact if invalidated:** Delays in engineering and QA validation phases.\n2. No major scope changes after March 31. **Impact if invalidated:** Timeline and checkpoint schedule may need rework.\n3. QA resources remain dedicated throughout June. **Impact if invalidated:** Risk to meeting July launch readiness.\n\n---\n\n## Referenced Artifacts\n- Q3_Launch_Project_Plan_v2.xlsx\n- Marketing_Campaign_Timeline.pdf\n- Engineering_Development_Schedule.docx\n\n---\n\n## Attendees\n- Sarah Kim - Product Manager\n- James Lee - Engineering Lead\n- Priya Patel - Marketing Manager\n- Carlos Gomez - QA Lead\n- Emily Chen - Project Coordinator\n",
