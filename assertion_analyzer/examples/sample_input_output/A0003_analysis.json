escalate if slippage > 3 days                 | Sarah Mitchell - Project Manager |\n| Design team limited bandwidth in May could delay asset finalization   | Prioritize critical assets early; consider temporary contractor support if needed | Luis Gomez - Design Lead         |\n| Content team cannot start until design assets approved                | Pre-draft content structure while waiting; confirm design approval date weekly    | Emma Chen - Content Strategist   |\n| Marketing cannot launch without finalized product documentation       | Align documentation completion with content timeline; add buffer for final review | James Lee - Marketing Lead       |\n\n---\n\n## Assumptions\n1. **All design assets will be approved by May 30**  \n   *Impact if invalidated:* Content creation start will slip, impacting marketing kickoff.\n2. **No additional scope will be added to the engineering backlog after March 20**  \n   *Impact if invalidated:* Engineering freeze could be delayed, pushing QA and design.\n3. **Marketing campaign cannot launch without finalized product documentation**  \n   *Impact if invalidated:* Launch readiness and compliance risk if documentation incomplete.\n\n---\n\n## Action Items (Traced to Discussion)\n- Update the workback plan to include explicit dependencies between engineering, design, and content tasks (Completed in Dependencies section).\n- Flag any tasks that are blocking others for visibility in the project dashboard (Blockers table included).\n- Set up weekly dependency check-ins to monitor risk (Mitigation strategy for engineering and design delays).\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:** Sarah Mitchell to circulate updated plan and schedule first dependency check-in by 2025-03-15.\n",
