Review CPU burn and network latency experiment outcomes  \n  2. Discuss Prometheus alert threshold adjustments (P95 latency & error rate)  \n  3. Examine OWASP ZAP and Trivy scan remediation recommendations  \n  4. Validate Grafana dashboard JSON export v3.0 and templating variables  \n  5. Plan next sprint dependency upgrades and Jira ticket assignments  \n  6.

2025-06-29T19:00:00+08:00 (≈ June 29, 11:00 UTC) ➔ **~24 hours until meeting**  \n\n---\n\n## **Workback Timeline (Aggressive, 1-Day Prep Remaining)**\n\n### **Phase 1: Material Finalization & Agenda Confirmation (June 29, EOD UTC)**\n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Confirm final agenda alignment** with organizer | Terina Hafen | **June 29, 18:00 UTC** | Based on agenda outlined in event body; verify no additions from security or chaos leads |\n| **Validate ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx** for completeness | Ashley Engel | **June 29, 20:00 UTC** | Ensure CVE remediation steps and alert validation details are up to date for review |\n| **Compile Prometheus alert & Grafana updates summary** | Jack Schrott | **June 29, 20:00 UTC** | Pull latest PromQL threshold tests & Grafana dashboard JSON v3.0 from staging |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Pre-read & Distribution (Latest Tonight UTC)**  \n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Prepare consolidated pre-read deck (if needed) OR annotated Excel** | Ashley Engel + Jack Schrott | **June 29, 21:00 UTC** | Merge chaos experiment results + alert adjustments in a single reference doc |\n| **Email/Teams message pre-read to all attendees** | Terina Hafen | **June 29, 22:00 UTC** | Include MS Teams link + highlight key discussion points |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Logistics & Tech Setup (Night-before + Morning-of)**  \n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Confirm meeting room booking & Teams link active** | Terina Hafen | **June 29, 23:00 UTC** | Double-check 5th Floor Conference Room setup and hybrid access |\n| **Validate dashboard and alert panels live in staging** | Jack Schrott | **June 30, 07:00 UTC** | Test Prometheus histogram_quantile queries and Grafana JSON export |\n| **Double-check security scan outputs** (OWASP ZAP, Trivy) | Markita / Security delegate (TBD) | **June 30,

pre-read deck and dashboards on presentation machine** | Terina Hafen | **June 30, 10:30 UTC** | Avoid last-minute display issues |\n| **Send reminder via Teams 30 min before start** | Terina Hafen | **June 30, 10:30 UTC** | Include recording enablement for remote attendees |\n\n---\n\n## **Dependencies & Risk Notes**  \n- **Tight timeline:** All prep tasks need parallel execution – leverage group chat (#LiveOak-Security-Team) for real-time coordination.  \n- **Critical dependency:** ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx must be corrected before agenda confirmation, as it drives main Q&A focus.  \n- **Tech rehearsal skipped:** Relying on staging validation prior to meeting.  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Summary Checklist (Before 11:00 UTC, June 30):**  \n✔ Agenda confirmed  \n✔ Chaos & security data validated  \n✔ Alerts & dashboard updates verified  \n✔ Pre-read distributed to all participants  \n✔ Meeting logistics tested  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **(A)** draft a **Teams message with all

(Keren Guisbert)  \n  - Grafana export → DevOps Eng. (Jack Schrott)  \n  - Logistics & coordination → Terina Hafen  \n\n---\n\n✅ This plan covers: agenda, metrics, security summaries, dashboard readiness, Jira templates, pre-reads, and hybrid AV setup, all sequenced for a 7-day runway.\n\n---\n\n**Next step suggestion:**  \nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-share checklist or a Gantt-style visualization** for this workback plan so your team can track progress easily in Teams or Confluence?

setup in 5th Floor Conf Room + Teams link | **June 25 (Wed)** | Ossie Ziller | Confirm HDMI and screen share work for hybrid format. |\n| Send pre-read materials (summary deck + OWASP remediation list) to attendees | **June 26 (Thu)** | Terina Hafen | Upload in Teams channel; mark reading as optional but encouraged. |\n| Confirm RSVP and address time zone clarity | **June 27 (Fri)** | Shawnna Schelp | Ensure global attendees know it’s 11:00 UTC. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Final Prep & Dry Run**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|-------|\n| Conduct 15-min dry run: Deck review, screen share check | **June 28 (Sat)** | Terina Hafen + Jack Schrott | Focus on technical content and transitions. |\n| Print/share backup visualizations (Grafana dashboards) in case of screen issues | **June 29 (Sun)** | Wilford Taussig | Optional contingency. |\n\n---\n\n### **MEETING DAY – June 30, 2025**\n- Log in 15 min early.\n- Have open: Summary deck, Grafana dashboard, and Jira board for real-time Q&A.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Assumptions & Notes\n- All meeting details from event data are **accurate and confirmed**.\n- No notes on public holidays (US) conflicting with deadlines; timeline assumes normal working schedule.\n- Owners assigned based on security & DevOps roles from attendee list; if unclear, confirm assignments in Teams.\n- Aggressive but possible timeline → recommend daily quick sync if blockers occur.\n\n---\n\n✅ **This plan ensures all prep materials, logistics, and stakeholders are aligned before June 30 with enough buffer for review.**  \nWould you like me to **(1) generate this as a downloadable MS Planner template**, or **(2) create a Teams channel task board for tracking?**", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "",
