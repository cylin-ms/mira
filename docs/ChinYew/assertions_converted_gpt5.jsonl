Prioritize deliverables and confirm dependencies ASAP.\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation Goals Anchored on Context**\n- Integration work referenced in numerous recent messages:\n  - Jenkins security pipeline (parallelization, failure gating logic – see *Jenkinsfile.security.groovy*, DAST gating snippet)\n  - Vault Secret Management (Tisa authored a technical deep dive PDF on July 23)\n  - Compliance enforcement stage (mentions of staging dry run, Liquibase annotations, rollback metrics readiness)\n- Meeting likely to be a 1:1 checkpoint with Nila (an Engineering Manager) to confirm:  \n  - Status of compliance tasks  \n  - Pipeline enhancement progress  \n  - Documentation readiness  \n  - Any remaining risk items (rollback safeguards, Prometheus alerts, Confluence updates)\n\n---\n\n# **Workback Plan for “1:1 Action Items Review” (Meeting: 2025-07-26, 14:00 PST)**\n\n### **PHASE 1: TODAY THROUGH JULY 24 (Planning & Alignment)**\n**1. Confirm Meeting Objectives & Scope**\n- **Due:** Jul 24 EOD PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Notes:** Validate whether Nila expects focus on:\n  - Compliance stage rollout & OpenSCAP scans  \n  - Vault token reuse optimization (staging test post-matrix parallelization)  \n  - Liquibase audit rule enforcement status  \n- **Dependency:** None; email/Teams ping Nila for clarity.\n\n**2. Consolidate Open Items from Recent Threads**\n- **Due:** Jul 24 EOD PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Notes:** Pull from:\n  - Compliance Enforcement Stage Chat (#platform-planning)  \n  - Strategy doc: *Compliance_Enforcement_Snippet.groovy*  \n  - Vault Deep Dive PDF (File: `Vault_Secret_Management_Deep_Dive.pdf`)  \n- **Output:** Draft list of open action items (e.g., retroactiveScan signoff, rollback metrics PR merge).\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 2: MAIN PREP (JULY 25)**\n**3. Draft 1-Pager for Discussion**\n- **Due:** Jul 25, 14:00 PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Notes:** Summarize:\n  - Action items status + blockers  \n  - References to prior deep dives (*FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx*, *Security_Automation_Outcomes_DeepDive.pptx*)  \n  - Highlight due dates vs current progress (+ any JIRA tags like FEDRAMP-102/103 if applicable)\n- **Dependency:** Phase 1 output finalized.\n\n**4. Verify Artifact Accessibility**\n- **Due:** Jul 25, COB PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Notes:** Ensure:\n  - Latest Jenkinsfile/security snippets accessible in repo  \n  - Confluence links for runbook & compliance gating docs live  \n  - Metrics dashboards and PromQL queries validated in Grafana \n- **Risk:** Metrics panel sync requires coordination with ops (Danille) – flag early.\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 3: FINAL TOUCHPOINT (JULY 26 MORNING)**\n**5. Final Review & Prep Meeting Notes**\n- **Due:** Jul 26, 09:00 PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Deliverable:**  \n  - Confirm Teams meeting link functionality  \n  - Rehearse key points (compliance scan status, Liquibase annotations, rollback metrics, schedule for next steps)\n- **Dependency:** Completed 1-pager ready to share on call.\n\n**6. Share Pre-Read (Optional but Recommended)**\n- **Due:** Jul 26, 2 hours before meeting  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Content:** PDF or Teams message with:\n  - Summary of action items vs status  \n  - Links to critical docs:\n    - `Vault_Secret_Management_Deep_Dive.pdf`\n    - `Security_Automation_Outcomes_DeepDive.pptx`\n    - `FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx`\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Assumptions & Risks**\n- Meeting agenda is inferred from context (recent compliance, pipeline, and secret management initiatives).\n- Only Nila is confirmed attendee from calendar. If others join, adjust pre-read distribution.\n- Very tight timeline: any slip in consolidation (Phase 1) will compress review time.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Practicality Check\n- **2.5 days total** → immediate action is critical. Most tasks align with Tisa’s role (pipeline owner).\n- Slack time minimal; bake in dependency checks early (e.g., metric validation may need Danille/Saul).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table View**\n\n|

Look for Snyk/Clair rollout details; note if any scheduling overlaps with planned July 30 brown-bag. |\n| Assemble key supporting links for quick review | **Jul 25 (EOD PST)** | Nila Tanguma | Create a short link bundle (e.g., Confluence page or email draft) with references from Shared Documents and S3 artifacts:  \n— pipeline_test_coverage.xlsx (coverage thresholds)  \n— Jenkins coverage.groovy param doc (AIUTW-006) |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3 – Pre-Distribute Pre-Reads**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|-------|\n| Send confirmed agenda + key file links to Tisa (and CC self for reference) | **Jul 25 (EOD PST)** | Nila Tanguma | Include summary of open items to review; mark any “decision required” points. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4 – Technical Readiness**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|-------|\n| Validate Teams meeting link & calendar entry | **Jul 25** | Nila Tanguma | Event already booked; just confirm PST vs personal TZ offset. |\n| Ensure meeting notes template prepared (action log) | **Jul 26 (morning PST)** | Nila Tanguma | Template can be pulled from previous workshops’ Confluence notes. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Dependencies & Risks**\n- **Risk:** Tight turnaround for pre-read preparation; mitigate by prioritizing most critical action items (AIUTW-003 & AIUTW-006 + compliance gating updates).  \n- **Dependency:** You may need responses from Shakia (pipeline params status) and Danille (DevSecOps updates). Build buffer for chasing updates on Jul 24 AM PST.  \n\n---\n\n### **Visual Timeline**\n- **Jul 24** → Draft agenda, confirm goals with Tisa.  \n- **Jul 25 AM** → Collect statuses; **Jul 25 EOD** → Send agenda & links.  \n- **Jul 26** → Final tech check, review notes template. Meeting @ 14:00 PST.  \n\n---\n\n✅ **Assumptions:**  \n- Meeting is still scheduled for July 26 @ 14:00 PST (update if rescheduled).  \n- Only you and Tisa will attend; keep prep lean and focused on decision-making.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **draft the actual agenda message + link bundle (email-ready)** for you next?

Adjust if resources have availability limits. All deadlines consider today’s date (July 12), giving about two weeks.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Readiness (July 25–26)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|-------|\n| **Finalize talking points for 1:1** | **July 25 (Fri)** | Nila | Summarize progress on LB-1246 (Jenkins & Prometheus updates), LB-1250 (threshold alignment). Prepare a status dashboard screenshot if available. |\n| **Confirm Teams link and time zone** | July 25 | Nila | Meeting link verified from event (already online). Quick calendar double-check. |\n| **Send pre-meeting status email to Tisa** *(optional but recommended)* | July 25 | Nila | Include ticket status, blockers, and next steps so both parties align before the call. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Progress Verification & Evidence Gathering (July 21–24)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|-------|\n| **Verify Jenkins & alert rule updates are live** | July 23 | Nila | Validate LB-1246 deliverable: coverage.groovy & rollback alerting (increase(canary_rollback_initiated_total…), rollback P95 checks) per latest metrics doc. |\n| **Run dashboard checks in Grafana** | July 23 | Nila | Confirm panels for Migration P95, Rollback P95, and Success Rate meet thresholds (>0.98 success, rollback <2.5s). Panels referenced in Grafana deep dive document. |\n| **Close or update JIRA LB-1250 (Threshold Alignment)** | July 24 | Nila | Ensure observability rules align with documented thresholds (Migration ≤2s, Rollback ≤2.5s, per Migration_Rollback_DetailedMetrics.xlsx). |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Mid-Prep Deep Dive (July 16–20)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|-------|\n| **Pull latest metrics from staging or prod** | July 19 | Nila | Collect Prometheus query outputs: histogram_quantile(0.95...) and rollback error rate for discussion. Screenshots optional but helpful. |\n| **Draft updated observability snippet for runbook (if pending)** | July 20 | Nila | If any Jenkins/Grafana alignment tasks remain, prep snippet for upcoming runbook PR. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Early Checkpoint & Gap Identification (July 12–15)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|-------|\n| **Review outstanding action items spreadsheet (Migration_Rollback_DetailedMetrics.xlsx)** | July 13 | Nila | Identify which items from LB-1246 and LB-1250 remain open; confirm if dependencies on Era/Shakia exist. |\n| **Confirm environment access** | July 15 | Nila | Ensure Jenkins, Prometheus, and Grafana access required to validate observability thresholds. |\n\n---\n\n## **Assumptions and Risks**\n- This plan assumes LB-1246 and LB-1250 are relevant to the agenda based on your previous leadership in Jenkins & metrics automation.\n- If new or unrelated objectives exist, adjust tasks accordingly.\n- Tight coupling with DevOps pipeline work means delays in staging verification can cascade → build 1-day buffer where possible.\n- No additional attendees → simpler logistics (Teams link is set).\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Quick Access References\n- **Event link:** [Teams Meeting](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/c74dcac5-465b-4658-bfda-3ab9545c1690)\n- **Critical files:**  \n   - *Migration_Rollback_DetailedMetrics.xlsx* for action item statuses  \n   - *Grafana_MigrationRollback_Panel_DeepDive.docx* for panel configuration  \n- **Key metrics:**  \n   - Migration P95 ≤ 2s  \n   - Rollback P95 ≤ 2.5s  \n   - Rollback success ≥ 98%  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **(a)** turn this into a **calendar-ready task schedule** with reminders in Outlook/Teams, or **(b)** create a

Keep concise, as this is a 30-min meeting. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Day of Meeting (July 18)**\n- **08:30 PDT**: Quick review of agenda and docs; confirm Teams setup.\n- **09:00 PDT**: Run session efficiently — focus on:\n  1. Quick recap of optimization outcomes.\n  2. Current CI/CD pipeline hot spots (compliance gates, performance).\n  3. Alignment on next iteration (action items and owners).\n\n---\n\n## **Assumptions & Outstanding Items**\n- **Assumed agenda goals**: Align CI/CD pipeline optimizations; validate compliance measures; discuss next improvements — inferred from related docs (_Optimization_Workshop*, *Integration_Test_Suite_CI_Enforcement_Detailed.docx*).\n- If additional attendees beyond Nila are required, clarify ASAP (currently only Nila confirmed).\n- Public holidays not considered; adjust if org calendar differs.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary View (Reverse Timeline)**\n\n| Date | Task |\n|------|------|\n| **July 18 08:30** | Final review before meeting |\n| **July 17 16:00** | Send agenda & pre-reads |\n| **July 17 15:00** | Finalize agenda |\n| **July 17 10:30** | Confirm access to docs |\n| **July 16

Related context: CI/CD improvements were heavily discussed in the *Unit Test Workshop* planning doc (Shared Documents/Workshops/UnitTestWorkshop_PlanningDocument.docx), especially around **Jenkins pipeline, coverage.groovy, Testcontainers integration**.\n\n**Current time:** July 11, 2025, 17:00 (UTC+8)  \n**Days available:** About **6 calendar days** (4 business days if excluding weekend) before the meeting on **July 18**.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 2: Identify Key Inputs\n- **Themes likely in scope:** Jenkins pipeline parameterization, SonarQube gates, coverage thresholds, integration tests in CI (from UnitTestWorkshop doc).\n- **Stakeholders:** You (Eng. Manager), Shakia (Senior Engineer), likely other pipeline contributors—but none explicitly listed.  \n- **No pre-attached agenda → must create and circulate.**\n- **File reference:** Use *UnitTestWorkshop_PlanningDocument* for CI/CD strategy section (and prior decisions around Testcontainers, Jenkinsfile, SonarQube).  \n- **Dependencies:** Confirm if rollback automation lessons need to be surfaced (from recent emails on Migration-Rollback, but keep core focus on CI/CD improvements for future sprints).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 3: Workback Timeline (from July 18 backward)\n\n### **Meeting Date: Friday, July 18, 09:00 PDT**  \n**Goal:** Enter discussion well-prepared with solid agenda, relevant metrics, and proposed optimization points.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1 – Final Prep**\n**July 17 (EOD PDT)**  \n**Task:** Confirm final agenda and talking points  \n- **Owner:** Nila  \n- **Notes:** Consolidate Shakia’s input for pipeline optimization proposals, ensuring coverage gates & Jenkinsfile strategy from Unit Test Workshop doc are included.\n\n**July 17 (EOD PDT)**  \n**Task:** Distribute final agenda + pre-read packet  \n- **Owner:** Nila  \n- **Notes:** Include:\n  - Agenda topics\n  - Attach *UnitTestWorkshop_PlanningDocument.docx* (CI/CD Integration Strategy section, coverage thresholds, Jenkins pipeline changes)\n  - Any pull request summaries or metrics snapshots from Jenkins/Sonar\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2 – Drafting & Input Gathering**\n**July 16**  \n**Task:** Draft meeting agenda & discussion objectives  \n- **Owner:** Nila  \n- **Dependencies:** Review UnitTestWorkshop doc Section “CI/CD Integration Strategy”; extract:\n  - Jenkinsfile coverage.groovy parameterization\n  - SonarQube quality gate enforcement\n  - Dynamic coverage threshold approach\n- **Notes:** Draft will define ~3 focus areas (e.g., pipeline performance, coverage enforcement, future automation).\n\n**July 16**  \n**Task:** Request inputs from Shakia on recent pipeline experiments  \n- **Owner:** Nila  \n- **Dependencies:** Slack/Teams message to Shakia to provide:\n  - Any pipeline pain points since workshop\n  - Suggestions on PR validation or rollback automation alignment\n- **Notes:** Ask for feedback by EOD to finalize agenda next day.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3 – Logistics & Pre-Read Prep**\n**July 15**  \n**Task:** Validate related documentation & links  \n- **Owner:** Nila  \n- **Dependencies:** Access Shared Documents → *UnitTestWorkshop_PlanningDocument.docx*; check if Jenkinsfile snippet references are up-to-date.\n- **Notes:** Highlight CI/CD section for meeting materials. Ensure Teams link in event works. No physical setup needed since meeting is online.\n\n**July 15**  \n**Task:** Draft outline of agenda topics  \n- **Owner:** Nila  \n- **Notes:** Initial draft so Shakia can review by next day. Include placeholders for “Open Items” + “Next Steps”.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4 – Kickoff**\n**July 14**  \n**Task:** Calendar reminder to attendees (if others added)  \n- **Owner:** Nila  \n- **Notes:** Since only Shakia & you appear so far, confirm if any other engineers need to be included (e.g., Wilford for observability, Era for Jenkins support).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Timeline Overview

| 09:00 PDT on Teams                         |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Key Assumptions\n- Attendees are only you (Nila) and Shakia unless more are invited.  \n- Pre-reads will draw from *UnitTestWorkshop_PlanningDocument*—no new docs mentioned.  \n- No dedicated rehearsal needed (short meeting, discussion format).  \n- Current timeline assumes no extra dependencies like third-party review cycles.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 **Next Action for You (Nila):**\nStart **July 14 reminder & attendee confirmation**, then allocate July 15–16 to pull focused agenda topics from the workshop doc and secure Shakia’s CI/CD updates.\n\nWould you like me to **generate the actual draft agenda and pre-read email now**, using the content from the Unit Test Workshop planning doc (Section 5: CI/CD Integration Strategy)?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should state the meeting [SUBJECT], [DATE/TIME], [TIMEZONE], and [ATTENDEES]", "level":

Overview of integration test architecture & environment setup\n  2. Code walkthrough: `JwtCacheLRU` tests in `AuthServiceTest.java`\n  3. Live demo: vault container spin-up, WireMock setup\n  4. Integer overflow guard tests using `AssertThrows`\n  5. Emitting & verifying eviction/overflow metrics (Prometheus)\n  6. CI pipeline integration: Jenkinsfile & GitHub Actions config\n  7. Q&A + next steps (assign test enhancements, pipeline PR reviews)\n- **Attachment:** `JWT_Cache_Integration_Test_Plan.docx`\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Time Remaining\n**~14 calendar days** before the workshop. Timeline allows structured prep with buffer for reviews and dry-run.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Workback Plan (Starting from Meeting Date → Backward)\n\n### **PHASE 1: Final Check (Day of / Day Before)**  \n| **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes / Dependencies** |\n|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Finalize and send **Teams link + last-minute reminders** | Jul 23 | Organizer (Shakia) | Ensure updated agenda and any last-minute changes are communicated |\n| Validate tech setup: Teams screen-share, demo environment | Jul 23 | Emory (DevOps), Shakia | Confirm vault container & WireMock are prepped and running |\n| Review Q&A placeholder deck and confirm roles for handling live queries | Jul 23 | All presenters | Quick alignment during final sync |\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 2: Dry Run (H-3 days)**  \n| **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes / Dependencies** |\n|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Conduct **full dry-run** of the integration test demo | Jul 21 | Shakia + Era + Emory | Practice steps in JWT_Cache_Integration_Test_Plan.docx |\n| Ensure **metrics emission (Prometheus) dashboards** configured for live metrics display | Jul 21 | Emory | Validate alert rules trigger correctly |\n| Validate CI integration (Jenkinsfile + GitHub Actions) on staging branch | Jul 21 | Era (+ Emory) | Dry run includes checking for broken pipelines |\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 3: Material Finalization & Distribution**  \n| **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes / Dependencies** |\n|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Finalize **presentation deck + demo scripts** (based on attached test plan) | Jul 19 | Shakia + Rufina | Use agenda points; ensure code snippets for `AuthServiceTest.java` and overflow test cases are included |\n| Distribute **pre-read (JWT_Cache_Integration_Test_Plan.docx)** to attendees with read-ahead instructions | Jul 18 | Organizer | Include: key sections to review, expected environment readiness |\n| Collect stakeholder inputs/questions for Q&A section | Jul 18 | All Attendees | Quick Teams thread or shared doc |\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 4: Environment & Code Prep** *(Start ~1 week ahead)*  \n| **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes / Dependencies** |\n|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Merge **vault + WireMock container provisioning scripts** into test branch | Jul 16 | Emory | Confirm Docker images versioned & documented |\n| Prepare **sample JWT cache overflow dataset**, validate `AssertThrows` guards | Jul 16 | Rufina | Ensure aligned with latest auth-service spec |\n| Update CI pipeline config with new test stage for JWT cache integration | Jul 16 | Era | Stub GitHub Action YAML + Jenkinsfile stage |\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Dependencies\n- JWTCaching tests require working **vault container** and **WireMock endpoints**.\n- **Metric dashboards** (Prometheus/Grafana) must be pre-configured—dependency for live demo.\n- CI changes (Jenkinsfile, GitHub Action) need approval before dry-run.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations\n- **Risk:** Late CI pipeline failure → **Mitigation:** Smoke test on Jul 16 after pipeline changes.\n- **Risk:** Missing environment configs → Set up infra by Jul 16, hold quick sync if any blocker.\n- **Tight timeline:** Allocate **buffer**: Dry run 3 days before, final check 1 day before.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Summary of Critical Dates\n- **Jul 16:** Code & environment setup completed.\n- **Jul 18:** Pre-read & agenda sent.\n- **Jul 19:** Deck/demo scripts finalized.\n- **Jul 21:** Dry-run completed.\n- **Jul 23:** Final tech check.\n- **Jul 24:** Workshop day.\n\n---\n\n🤔 **Want me to draft:**  \n- A **Teams-ready agenda deck outline** using the points above?  \n- Or a **structured checklist in MS Planner** with owners and deadlines?\n\n👉

Review detailed instrumentation metrics and threshold settings.  \n  2. Validate memoryThreshold impacts on batch sizing.  \n  3. Align on final telemetry pipeline configurations.  \n  4. Assign action items for CI/CD integration.  \n- **Attachments & Related Files:**  \n  - `DynamicBatchSizingResearchPaper.pdf` (FileId: b54dce37…)  \n  - `DynamicBatchSizing_Panel_Review.json` (Grafana config updated July 24)  \n  - `incident_postmortem_metrics_analysis.xlsx` and `IncidentPerformance_DeepAnalytics.xlsx` (threshold metrics & PromQL alert tuning)  \n- **Current Date:** July 25, 2025 → ~**2.5 business days remaining** (tight timeline!)\n\n---\n\n### **Assumptions**\n- Participants have access to SharePoint folder `EngineeringDocuments` and Confluence where these files are stored.\n- No holidays fall between 07/25 and 07/28.\n- Final configuration decisions will freeze by meeting date to avoid downstream delays.\n\n---\n\n## **Timeline & Tasks**\n\n### **Phase 1 – Prep & Alignment (Today, July 25)**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| **Kick-off alignment via email/chat** summarizing final agenda & critical pre-read list | **EOD July 25** | **Shari Jatho** | Include: research paper, threshold rationale, latest Grafana JSON, incident metrics workbook |\n| Confirm **meeting logistics & Teams link** | **EOD July 25** | **Shari Jatho** | Link already in invite → verify no conflicts & notify attendees |\n| Assign SME responsibilities: who will lead discussion on thresholds, CI/CD impact, Prometheus alert rules | **EOD July 25** | **Shari Jatho** | Suggested: Cortez → pipeline config, Ashley → alert tuning, Era → R&D context |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2 – Pre-Read Review & Content Prep (Weekend / Early Monday)**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Review `DynamicBatchSizingResearchPaper.pdf` for updated **GC pause improvements (25%) & PromQL queries** | **July 26 (Sat)** | **All attendees** | Focus on sections 3 (threshold rationale) & 4.2 (impact) |\n| Verify incident performance data in `incident_postmortem_metrics_analysis.xlsx` (Alerts for thrash >2/5m & cold latency P95) | **July 26** | **Bev Mcginty & Ashley Engel** | Ensure alert thresholds match Opsgenie `controlRef SI-10` integration |\n| Prepare **short slide snippet or talking points** summarizing memoryThresholdMb results (125–175MB sweep) & Grafana changes | **July 27 AM** | **Cortez Dehn** | Pull visual from updated dashboard JSON, include heatmap panel screenshot |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3 – Finalization & Dry Run (Morning of July 28)**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Confirm telemetry schema PR & Jenkins shared library updates status | **July 28 10:00 AM PDT** | **Era Manteca + Tisa Odonoghue** | Ensure defaultLabels injection & Prometheus alert YAML tested in staging |\n| Upload final Grafana dashboard JSON & alert rules to Confluence | **July 28 Noon PDT** | **Ashley Engel** | Include updated thresholds: 600ms warm-up, 500ms steady |\n| Quick **15-min sync (optional)** to validate agenda flow & screen-sharing readiness | **July 28 12:30 PM PDT** | **Shari Jatho + presenters** | Dry run key talking points; confirm no metrics query errors |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4 – Meeting Day**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Start Teams session early (5–10 min) for audio/visual check | **July 28 13:50 PDT** | **Shari Jatho** | Load dashboard & XLS workbooks beforehand |\n| Capture decisions & owners in real-time (OneNote/Confluence) | During meeting | **Loria Furlan** | Summarize threshold settings, gating policy, CI/CD next steps |\n| Send post-meeting recap email with action items & links | By EOD July 28 | **Shari Jatho** | Include download links for revised alert YAML & Grafana panel |\n\n---\n\n## **Critical Dependencies**\n- **Pre-reads distributed today** so SMEs can prepare over weekend.\n- **Grafana JSON + Prometheus alert rules** finalized before meeting (dependencies on Cortez & Ashley).\n- Must confirm Vault integration and Opsgenie compliance flags (`controlRef` SI-10) before sign-off—ties back to compliance-mapping spreadsheet.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Download Summary of Pre-Reads**\n- [DynamicBatchSizingResearchPaper.pdf]  \n- [IncidentPerformance_DeepAnalytics.xlsx]  \n- [incident_postmortem_metrics_analysis.xlsx]  \n- [DynamicBatchSizing_Panel_Review.json]\n\n---\n\n#### **Potential Risks**\n- Tight timeline: allocate contingency hour early July 28 if any artifact validation fails.\n- If pipeline PR isn’t merged by mid-day July 28, meeting may only sign off on design—not deployment.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to also provide a ready-to-share email template that bundles this workback plan and the pre-read links for the attendees?**  \n(Yes/No)", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should include a

Ping organizer via Teams chat. |\n| **Draft agenda** (3–4 bullets) | Thu, Jul 24 | Shakia (Review: Danille) | Include: 1) Intro & session goals, 2) Common exporter pitfalls, 3) Q&A time allocation. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Content & Pre-Read Prep (July 24–July 26)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Compile reference docs & code snippets** | Fri, Jul 25 | Danille | Pull from engineering wiki / internal repo: example OTLP exporter YAML, environment variable config, troubleshooting tips. |\n| **Identify likely FAQ topics** (from telemetry pipeline PRs & prior chats) | Fri, Jul 25 | Danille & Emory | Examples: TLS cert trust for OTLP endpoints, batching config, metrics export performance. |\n| **Create a concise pre-read deck or doc** | Sat, Jul 26 | Danille (draft) → Shakia (approve) | 3 slides max: Quick start snippet, exporter topology diagram, common errors + resolutions. Save in **EngineeringDocuments/Presentations** and share Teams link. |\n| **Distribute pre-read to all attendees** | Sat, Jul 26 | Shakia | Attach deck to meeting invite or post in Teams channel “Platform-Observability.” |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Logistics & Tech Setup (July 27–July 28)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Validate Teams link & permissions** | Sun, Jul 27 | Shakia | Confirm no blocked attendee access. |\n| **Prepare OTLP exporter demo scenario** (optional) | Mon, Jul 28 | Danille | Spin up sandbox with OTLP endpoint enabled; test collector config works (if time allows). |\n| **Rehearse flow & roles** | Mon, Jul 28 | Danille + Shakia | 10-min sync: who introduces, who screenshares, time for Q&A. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Day-of Meeting (July 29)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Circulate final agenda reminder in Teams chat** (with deck link) | Tue, Jul 29 – by 09:00 PDT | Danille | Quick note tagging all attendees. |\n| **Join 10 min early to test audio & share screen** | Tue, Jul 29 – 15:50 PDT | Danille | Ensure code snippet/demo environment reachable. |\n\n---\n\n## **Additional Notes & Assumptions**\n- **Agenda depth:** Timeboxed (30 min) → Keep materials minimal; focus on clarity.  \n- **No recorded inquiring doc on OTLP yet** → Create lightweight slide deck or Notion page; link from Teams.  \n- **Pre-read is critical** for attendees (esp. QA & Data Science) to shorten live Q&A time.  \n- **RISKS:** Short window before weekend; start content prep by Thu to avoid crunch on Mon.  \n- **Dependencies:** Shakia’s approval for final agenda; Emory’s input on FAQs.  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Summary at a Glance**\n- **Today:** Confirm scope & draft preliminary agenda  \n- **Fri (Jul 25):** Pre-read content collected & FAQ outlined  \n- **Sat (Jul 26):** Finalize & distribute pre-read  \n- **Mon (Jul 28):** Dry run & tech verification  \n- **Tue (Jul 29):** Execute meeting with confidence  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **also draft a 2-slide agenda deck template with placeholders for OTLP exporter details and common pitfalls** for you to populate?

me make a workback plan for the upcoming meeting 'OTLP Exporter Q&A Roundtable'", "response": "Based on the provided enterprise data and your request, here’s the **workback plan** for the upcoming meeting **“OTLP Exporter Q&A Roundtable”**:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Meeting Details  \n- **Meeting Name**: OTLP Exporter Q&A Roundtable  \n- **Organizer**: Shakia Gencarelli (lod_shakiag)  \n- **Date & Time**: **Tuesday, July 29, 2025 – 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM PDT**  \n- **Location**: Microsoft Teams (link in invite)  \n- **Attendees**:  \n  - Shakia Gencarelli (Engineering)  \n  - Danille Ciardullo (DevOps)  \n  - Emory Scherping (DevOps)  \n  - Miss Bjorkman (Frontend Tech Lead)  \n  - Ashley Engel (QA)  \n  - Porsha Brodbeck (Data Science)  \n  - Myles Mckoan (QA)  \n- **Current Time When You Asked**: July 16, 2025  \n- **Time Until Meeting**: ~13 calendar days (~9 business days)  \n\n---\n\n## 📅 **Workback Plan (Starting from July 29 and working backward)**\n\n---\n\n### **Day of Meeting (Tue, Jul 29)**  \n**Task**:  \n- Confirm tech readiness (Teams link, screen sharing enabled)  \n- Prepare backup dial-in and contact details  \n- Open meeting 5 mins early and facilitate Q&A flow  \n\n**Owner**: Shakia  \n**Notes**: Ensure any shared resources (FAQ or code samples) are pre-loaded.  \n\n---\n\n### **T-1 Day (Mon, Jul 28)**  \n**Task**:  \n- Send final **meeting reminder** with agenda and Teams link  \n- Share consolidated attendee Q&A topics and reference links (e.g., OTLP exporter configuration, common integration steps)  \n\n**Owner**: Shakia  \n**Dependencies**: Requires input collection completed  \n\n---\n\n### **T-2 Days (Fri, Jul 25)**  \n**Task**:  \n- Conduct optional **dry run / scenario prep** (simulate common questions, validate demo snippets if any)  \n- Validate environment or logs if planning to show live traces/exporter behavior  \n\n**Owner**: Shakia + Danille (if DevOps pipeline details involved)  \n**Notes**: Keep it brief (15 min); only if showing any exporter-related workflow  \n\n---\n\n### **T-3 Days (Thu, Jul 24)**  \n**Task**:  \n- Finalize **agenda deck / talking points** for meeting structure:  \n    - Quick intro  \n    - Core concepts review (OTLP exporter use cases)  \n    - Open forum Q&A slots (pre-collected + live)  \n\n**Owner**: Shakia  \n**Dependencies**: Needs consolidated question list  \n\n---\n\n### **T-5 Days (Tue, Jul 22)**  \n**Task**:  \n- Compile **attendee-submitted questions** and categorize themes (integration, troubleshooting, performance)  \n- Share draft agenda with stakeholders for feedback  \n\n**Owner**: Shakia  \n**Notes**: Ask attendees to provide last-minute topics by EOD  \n\n---\n\n### **T-7 Days (Fri, Jul 18)**  \n**Task**:  \n- Send **request for pre-submit questions** to attendees  \n- Include **background context** (scope: OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter configs, FAQs, performance optimizations, DevOps integration)  \n\n**Owner**: Shakia  \n**Dependencies**: None  \n**Notes**: Use Teams or email; deadline July 22 to incorporate feedback  \n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Key Considerations & Assumptions**  \n- **Assumption**: Agenda will follow Q&A-centric format, no formal slide deck unless needed for topic framing.  \n- **Related Context**: While there’s no OTLP planning doc in grounding data, prior workshops (e.g., unit test, optimization) show a pattern of distributing supporting material & running dry runs for tech sessions.  \n- **No hard dependencies on external assets** found—meeting likely scenario-based clarifications rather than deep technical demo.  \n- Attendees span multiple roles (DevOps, QA, Frontend, Data Science), so questions may cross functional boundaries — prepare reference links for:  \n  - OpenTelemetry exporter setup & configs  \n  - CICD integration points (Jenkins, Prometheus metrics alignment — inferred from similar prior sessions)  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Summary Table**\n\n| Date       | Task

Miss Bjorkman, Porsha, Myles) | **Jul 24** | Danille | Track acceptance in Outlook; follow up if needed |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Development of Content & Internal Review**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft meeting agenda (bullets: what is OTLP exporter, config patterns, error handling) | **Jul 20** | Danille | Incorporate sample Q&A structure from previous deep dive slide decks (e.g., TransactionRouter_Deep_Dive_Details.pptx) |\n| Compile pre-read materials (link to OpenTelemetry docs, exporter config YAML examples) | **Jul 21** | Danille + Emory | Align with internal telemetry standards; create diagrams if needed |\n| Internal review of draft slide deck | **Jul 23** | Shakia + Danille | Use Engineering portal templates & security review checklist (*Security Assessment Report v1.1.docx* for compliance references if needed) |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Logistics Check**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Verify Teams recording policy & link distributed | **Jul 22** | Shakia | Confirm attendees have required access |\n| Confirm participants' tech setup (client access, mic/camera) | **Jul 23** | Danille | Reach out to Porsha & Miss Bjorkman if bandwidth or tooling issue suspected |\n\n---\n\n## ⏳ **Overall Timeline Summary**\n- **Today (Jul 16):** Start agenda outline, identify required content sources  \n- **Jul 20:** Draft agenda ready  \n- **Jul 21:** Pre-read material compiled  \n- **Jul 23:** Deck review + logistics validation completed  \n- **Jul 24–25:** Send agenda & pre-reads, confirm attendance  \n- **Jul 28:** Dry run, finalize deck  \n- **Jul 29:** Meeting day  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Practical Next Steps for You, Danille**\n1. **Today (Jul 16):** Create agenda skeleton and review prior Q&A decks for structure.  \n2. **Ping Emory (DevOps) & Shakia (Organizer):** Align on top OTLP exporter questions.  \n3. **Book calendar slots:** Quick 15-min sync with Shakia by Jul 19 for agenda sign-off.  \n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation\n- **Risk:** Attendees don’t review material → include “pre-read required” in subject line.  \n- **Risk:** Tight turnaround for Q&A deck → use TransactionRouter templates to accelerate.  \n- **Risk:** Missing exporter configuration details → Assign Emory as SME for technical content.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **prepare a reusable template for the OTLP Q&A deck** (matching your previous TransactionRouter deep dive style) **or draft the actual email you’ll send with agenda and

No explicit full attendee list provided.  \n- **Objective:** Deep dive on pipeline performance improvements, HPA scaling adjustments, retry backoff logic, and CI/CD validator setup; likely linked to DevSecOps automation, validatePipelineSchema improvements, Prometheus monitoring enhancements.  \n- **Relevant Artifacts & Attachments:**  \n  - `DevSecOps_Workshop_Outcomes_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx` (Jul 21)  \n  - `PipelineValidation_Architecture_and_Best_Practices.docx`  \n  - `ValidatePipelineSchema_ImplementationGuide.docx`  \n  - `ScanMetrics_Threshold_Reference_Table.xlsx`  \n  - `DevSecOps_Automation_Pipeline_Deep_Dive.docx`  \n\n---\n\n### 🗓 **Step 2: Timeline Context**\n- **Today:** Tue, July 22, 2025 (PDT equivalent approx Jul 22 early AM)  \n- **Meeting:** Tue, August 5, 2025 → **14 days away**  \n- Weekends: Jul 26–27 and Aug 2–3 are non-working days → effectively ~10 working days.  \n- Plan assumes normal availability; aggressive actions noted where needed.  \n\n---\n\n## 📅 **Workback Schedule**\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Kickoff & Scope Confirmation**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm meeting scope, objectives, and final attendee list | **Jul 23 (Wed)** | **Wilford** with Shakia | Meeting covers pipeline performance, observability tuning, schema validation. Confirm if external teams (QA, Release, DevSecOps) need inclusion. Dependencies: none. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Agenda & Framework**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft detailed agenda for *Pipeline Performance Deep Dive* | **Jul 24 (Thu)** | Wilford | Include sections on: (1) Jenkins shared library validation (validatePipelineSchema), (2) Prometheus/Grafana alert refinements, (3) Retry logic performance impact, (4) DevSecOps pipeline outcomes.|\n| Circulate draft agenda for input | **Jul 25 (Fri)** | Wilford → Shakia + stakeholders | Allow at least 1 business day for comments. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Materials Development**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Gather key reference materials & finalize deck outline based on `DevSecOps_Workshop_Outcomes_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx` | **Jul 26 (Fri EOD)** | Wilford | Consolidate slides from July 21 workshop deck; integrate new metrics (P95/P99 scan latency, error-rate histograms). Use files: `PipelineValidation_Architecture_and_Best_Practices.docx`, `ValidatePipelineSchema_ImplementationGuide.docx`. |\n| Prepare updated performance graphs & scan threshold tables | **Jul 29 (Tue)** | Wilford + Ops Support | Leverage `ScanMetrics_Threshold_Reference_Table.xlsx` and Canary performance artifacts from staging. Ensure CI/CD metrics and alert rule YAML examples are included. |\n| Insert finalized agenda + discussion prompts into meeting deck | **Jul 30 (Wed)** | Wilford | Package as “Pipeline Performance Deep Dive Deck vFinal”. Upload to MS Teams + shared site. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Coordination & Reviews**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Share pre-read (deck + key docs) with attendees | **Aug 1 (Fri)** | Wilford | Include links to `EngineeringDocuments/Plans` and `Presentations` directory. Communicate “Required Read” sections. |\n| Stakeholder review & sign-off on metrics and alert thresholds | **Aug 2 (Sat)** \\* | Shakia + DevSecOps (Wilford assists) | Allow weekend buffer, but expect feedback early Aug 4. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Dry Run & Logistics**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Quick dry run of deck (10 min sync with Shakia) | **Aug 4 (Mon)** | Wilford + Shakia | Validate timing, flow, and technical accuracy. Adjust any updated screenshots or Prometheus alert code. |\n| Confirm Teams meeting link, screen share permissions, and test AV | **Aug 4 (Mon)** | Wilford | Verify against previous Teams configuration issues.

action items | **Aug 5 (Tue) 10:00 PDT** | Wilford | Take clear notes on upgrade decisions, alert tuning approvals, and rollout plans. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Important Assumptions & Notes**\n- **Meeting Date Confirmed:** Aug 5, 2025 at 10:00 PDT (from Event grounding).  \n- Owners assume Wilford acts as prep lead; Shakia as key technical stakeholder.  \n- Use provided presentation templates and validated artifacts—avoid new design reworks.  \n- Time is tight → combine agenda + material drafting in parallel where possible.  \n- Incorporate updated Prometheus/Grafana configs and retry backoff improvements from recent HPA tuning (see `Payments-Transactor_Deep_Dive.pptx` for visual consistency).  \n\n---\n\n### 🔗 **Key References**\n- `DevSecOps_Workshop_Outcomes_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx`  \n- `ValidatePipelineSchema_ImplementationGuide.docx`  \n- `PipelineValidation_Architecture_and_Best_Practices.docx`  \n- `ScanMetrics_Threshold_Reference_Table.xlsx`\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ Next Action for Wilford:\nStart **Phase 1 – Confirm attendee list & finalize scope by Jul 23** to avoid delays in downstream deliverables.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **also create a condensed one-page timeline table for quick copy-paste into Teams**, or draft the **initial agenda outline** for your review?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should

me make a workback plan for the upcoming meeting 'Security Pipeline Integration Workshop: Advanced Exercises & Threat Modeling'", "response": "Below is the **Comprehensive Workback Plan** for the upcoming meeting, anchored on the actual enterprise data provided.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 1: Extracted Meeting Details\n- **Meeting Name:** Security Pipeline Integration Workshop: Advanced Exercises & Threat Modeling  \n- **Scheduled Date & Time:** **July 30, 2025**, 17:00–19:00 PDT  \n- **Current Date/Time (request):** July 17, 2025 @ 01:00 (+08:00) → approx. **13 days remaining**  \n- **Organizer:** Danille Ciardullo (lod_danillec)  \n- **Your Role:** Bev Mcginty (QA Engineer) – Required Attendee  \n- **Other Required Attendees:** Cortez Dehn (DevOps), Sau Alquesta (Platform Lead), Saturnina Soyke (Director), Shawnna Schelp (Engineer)  \n- **Optional:** Nila Tanguma (Engineering Manager)  \n- **Purpose (from Event):**\n  - Dive deeper into dynamic scan failure threshold tuning\n  - Threat modeling exercises\n  - Extend Jenkins shared library live\n  - CI gating enhancements, Confluence automation\n\n- **Attachments:**  \n    - `Security_Automation_Pipeline_Detailed_Analysis.xlsx`  \n    - `Security Pipeline Workshop Agenda v2.pdf`  \n\n**→ These will inform agenda creation & pre-reads.**\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 2: Relevant Grounding Insights\n- Prior workshops (Fraud-Security Integration) included:\n  - **CI pipeline security gates with Bandit, SonarQube, OWASP ZAP**\n  - **Threat modeling templates and tasks** (Breakout risk mapping)\n- Current workshop extends that by adding **advanced gating logic** and **shared library coding**.\n\n**Implication:**  \nPre-work must:\n- Gather metrics on dynamic scan thresholds from previous sessions\n- Prepare Jenkinsfile.security.groovy snippet references\n- Update Confluence macro automation for publishing\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 3: Remaining Time\n- Today: July 17 → Meeting: July 30  \n- ~13 total days → ~9 business days if excluding weekends  \n- Aggressive, but feasible with overlapping tasks where dependencies allow.\n\n---\n\n# 📅 **WORKBACK PLAN**  \n*(Based on meeting start July 30, 2025 @ 17:00 PDT)*\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Preparation & Inputs (Today → July 22)**\n\n| Task | Due By | Owner | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|-------|\n| Review **Security Pipeline Workshop Agenda v2.pdf** & confirm alignment with goals | **July 18 (Fri)** | Danille (org) + Bev | Attachments in invite |\n| Collect input on **dynamic scan issues & gating pain points** from prior workshops | **July 19** | Bev (QA) | Pull data from Fraud-Security-Integration_Workshop_DetailedMetrics.xlsx |\n| Extract key metrics from `Security_Automation_Pipeline_Detailed_Analysis.xlsx` (DAST vs SAST failure rates) for pre-read summary | **July 19** | Cortez | Needed for agenda discussion |\n| Draft Threat Modeling breakout structure (map key services & potential high-risk flags) | **July 20** | Sau (Tech Lead) | Use FraudSecurity workshop design doc as ref |\n| Identify relevant Jenkins pipeline snippets and shared library hooks for **live coding phase** | **July 20** | Jack / Cortez | Pull from feature/fraud-security-integration |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Agenda Finalization & Pre-Reads (July 22 → July 26)**\n\n| Task | Due By | Owner | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|-------|\n| Finalize **workshop agenda & timebox** (including breakout sessions) | **July 22** | Danille | Incorporate updated objectives |\n| Draft and circulate **pre-read packet**: agenda + pipeline gating logic summary + metric charts | **July 24** | Danille | Sources: Attachments + Jenkinsfile fragments |\n| Confirm **Teams link and recording settings** | **July 24** | Danille | Link in event body already, just test |\n| Upload finalized **agenda/pre-read** to Confluence & link in calendar | **July 25** | Bev | Ensure PDFs + XLSX visible under Eng/Workshops |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Logistics & Dry Run (July 26 → July 29)**\n\n| Task | Due By | Owner | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|-------|\n| Validate **Jenkins demo pipeline** and sample threat-model worksheet for live exercise | **July 26** | Cortez + Sau | Use staging environment |\n| Prepare **Confluence automation macros** for publishing scan reports post-workshop | **July 27** | Bev | Previous pipeline work sets pattern |\n| Conduct **internal dry run** of the workshop flow (screen sharing, timing) | **July 29 (EOD)** | Danille + core presenters | Target: no tech issues |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Workshop Day (July 30)**\n\n| Task | Due By | Owner | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|-------|\n| Host session **17:00–19:00 PDT via Teams** | **July 30** | Danille | Recording to Teams folder |\n| Capture **action items for CI refactoring sprint** | During | Bev (scribe) | Post notes same day |\n\n---\n\n## 🔎 Assumptions & Risks\n✔ Meeting date confirmed via event: July 30  \n✔ Tasks assume 5-day work week; weekends skipped  \n⚠ Tight timeline: Pre-reads due on July 24 leaves only ~4 days for attendees to prep  \n⚠ Dependencies: Jenkins demo relies on environment stability → buffer on July 27  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Recommended Immediate Actions (Today)\n- **Bev:** Start review of agenda (PDF) and security metrics (XLSX)\n- **Danille:** Confirm workshop objectives and finalize preliminary agenda draft\n- **Cortez/Sau:** Begin pulling Jenkins snippets for live coding demo\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Deliverables Before Meeting\n- Pre-read packet posted to Confluence & circulated by **July 24**\n- Dry run complete by **July 29**\n- All demo/hands-on materials validated in staging by **July 27**\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **auto-generate this plan as a shareable MS Teams Planner board** or **export as an Excel timeline (Gantt style) for upload to the Shared Documents/Workshops site**?", "assertions":

Review production canary metrics vs staging thresholds  \n     *(cold-start ≤900ms, warm ≤130ms, memory cap ≤200MB)*\n  2. Analyze Prometheus & Grafana alert triggers: latency spikes, memory breaches, CB transitions\n  3. Postmortem rollback incident: timing, root cause, mitigation effectiveness\n  4. Action items: alert tuning refinements, Jenkins job improvements, documentation updates\n- **Attachments:** `v2.1.0_Canary_Postmortem.pdf`\n- **Related Context:** Previous work included Jenkins rollback automation, PromQL alert tuning, Grafana dashboards, and migration rollback strategies.\n\n---\n\n## ⏳ Time Horizon\n- **Meeting:** Wed, July 23  \n- **Today:** Thurs, July 17  \n- **Workable Days:** approx. **6 calendar days**, includes a weekend → **Aggressive timeline**\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Plan (Anchored to 2025-07-23)\n\n| **Phase** | **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes / Dependencies** |\n|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| **Phase 1: Pre-Read & Data Consolidation** |||||\n|  | Review attached `v2.1.0_Canary_Postmortem.pdf` for accuracy and completeness | **July 18 (Fri)** | Wilford Taussig | Confirm metrics and rollback content align with latest canary telemetry |\n|  | Consolidate critical Prometheus queries & Grafana screenshots for discussion | **July 18 (Fri)** | Wilford Taussig + Sau Alquesta | Pull queries like `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(...))) by (le, env)` for latency & CB state |\n|  | Update postmortem metric tables (P95 latency, memory spike data) | **July 18 (Fri)** | Bev Mcginty | Needs raw values from Prometheus; coordinate with Ops if gaps exist |\n| **Phase 2: Agenda & Action Framework Finalization** |||||\n|  | Confirm final agenda & distribute meeting invite notes | **July 19 (Sat)** | Wilford Taussig | Based on event agenda; include Slack link to PDF + data extracts |\n|  | Draft initial action item tracker template (alert tuning, Jenkins job fixes, runbook updates) | **July 19 (Sat)** | Octavia Jaso | Use Jira ticket convention like LB-XXXX, SEC-XXX |\n| **Phase 3: Technical Preps** |||||\n|  | Validate Grafana dashboard panels (cold/warm start, memory usage) | **July 20 (Sun)** | Sau Alquesta | Ensure threshold alerts (cold-start >900ms, etc.) working in staging |\n|  | Extract rollback incident logs and confirm root cause narrative | **July 20 (Sun)** | Danille Ciardullo | Pull Jenkins logs & canary job guard clause updates |\n|  | Prepare updated PromQL alert tuning proposal | **July 21 (Mon)** | Wilford Taussig | Based on observability workshop → differentiate thresholds for CPU vs network |\n| **Phase 4: Pre-Meeting Readiness** |||||\n|  | Circulate consolidated pre-reads (PDF, dashboards, alert proposals) to attendees | **July 21 (Mon)** | Wilford Taussig | Send via email with \"Pre-read: v2.1.0 Canary Postmortem\" subject |\n|  | Schedule brief sync for Q&A or dry-run (optional, 15 min) | **July 22 (Tue)** | Bev Mcginty | If dashboards/metrics complex, use Teams bridge |\n|  | Confirm Teams meeting link & recording setup | **July 22 (Tue)** | Wilford Taussig | Ensure transcription enabled (like prior brown-bag sessions) |\n| **Day of Meeting** |||||\n|  | Join early, load Grafana dashboards, Prometheus console | **July 23** | Host: Wilford Taussig | Verify network and screen-share permissions |\n|  | Have rollback flow diagrams and alert links in chat for quick reference | **July 23** | Danille Ciardullo | Based on prior runbook and EngineeringDocuments/MigrationRollback |\n\n---\n\n### 🔗 Key Dependencies:\n- Accurate pull of **production vs staging telemetry by July 18**\n- Latest alert definitions (see `Grafana_MigrationRollback_Panel_DeepDive.docx`, PromQL snippets in earlier mail threads)\n- Jira ticket alignment for postmortem follow-ups (LB-124x series for rollback; SEC-50x for chaos alert tuning)\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Assumptions & Risks:\n- **Assumption:** Current email and Teams notifications have reached all invitees; no conflicts on July 23.\n- **Risk:** Short turnaround for metric updates and dashboard validation over a weekend. Mitigation: Pre-assign backups for Sau or Danille if unavailable.\n- If new incidents occur before meeting, buffer time may shrink; recommend async checkpoint in Teams by July 21.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Recommended Next Step for You:\n**Today (July 17):**  \n- Confirm this timeline works for you and attendees.  \n- Assign Bev & Octavia to their tasks by EOD today.  \n- Ping Sau for Grafana readiness (critical for July 20 deliverable).  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **create a visual Gantt-style timeline** for these tasks or **generate an email draft to attendees with pre-read instructions**?",

Assume team members work weekdays primarily; plan accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Workback Plan (Starting from the Meeting Date → Backward)\n\n---\n\n### **Finalization Phase** (Day of Meeting & Day Before)\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Join meeting early and validate Teams link, screen sharing, and recordings | **July 23** 16:45 PDT | Wilford | Confirm everything works; test attachments (PDF deck, dashboards) |\n| Finalize updated Grafana dashboard panels & Prometheus queries for live reference | **July 22** | Sau | Ensure P95 latency & error rate panels match planned thresholds |\n| Send calendar reminder with agenda & final pre-reads (PDF + dashboard links) | **July 22** | Wilford | Include Teams link, PromQL refs, and expectation for attendees to review metrics |\n\n---\n\n### **Readiness Phase** (T‑3 to T‑5 days)\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Validate metrics extraction from Grafana & Prometheus for last 7 days (cold/warm start, memory usage) | **July 19** | Bev + Myles | Cross-check alerts triggered vs documented thresholds |\n| Dry-run slide walkthrough (*v2.1.0_Canary_Postmortem.pdf*) with Sau & Danille to confirm narrative flow | **July 19** | Wilford | Ensure alignment on rollback root cause story |\n| Update rollback incident root cause analysis section with confirmed timelines & mitigation steps | **July 18** | Danille | Pull details from Jenkins logs & any on-call notes |\n\n---\n\n### **Prep & Drafting Phase** (T‑6 to T‑10 days)\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft initial meeting narrative: metrics review, alert tuning, rollback analysis, action items | **July 16** | Wilford | Use attached PDF + engineering data; mirror flow from past postmortems |\n| Prepare PromQL snippet references for discussion (including histogram_quantile for P95 & CB transitions) | **July 15** | Sau | Pull existing tuned queries from monitoring-chaos-automation branch |\n| Refresh Grafana dashboard export for *Financial-Workflow-Metrics* (ensure correct env filters) | **July 15** | Octavia | Verify fault_type & environment variables work |\n| QA sanity-check canary thresholds vs staging baselines (cold start ≤900ms, warm ≤130ms, memory ≤200MB) | **July 14** | Bev | Compare staging test runs in EngineeringDocuments datasets |\n\n---\n\n### **Kickoff & Resource Gathering Phase** (Immediately)\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Review attached *v2.1.0_Canary_Postmortem.pdf* and extract sections for discussion | **July 11** | Wilford | Annotate action items and unresolved issues |\n| Collect Prometheus alert logs, Grafana screenshots, and Jenkins canary job failure snapshots | **July 11** | Danille + Myles | Organize in pre-read doc |\n| Define tech-check strategy for Teams meeting: screen share, recording enabled, dashboard access | **July 12** | Wilford | Confirm no VPN/device restrictions |\n| Confirm attendance & roles (who speaks to which section) | **July 12** | Wilford | Assign: Sau → metrics deep dive, Danille → rollback, QA → thresholds |\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Key Dependencies & Notes\n- Meeting posture is **metrics-heavy**; Grafana/Prometheus queries must be ready and validated no later than T-3 days.  \n- Dependencies:\n  - Danille’s rollback incident summary feeds directly into the core discussion and presentation updates.\n  - QA (Bev/Myles) inputs on threshold validation required before alert tuning recommendations freeze.\n- Risks:\n  - If dashboard export updates slip beyond July 19, dry run quality will degrade → mitigate by prioritizing dashboard readiness early.\n- Assumptions:\n  - All attendees are available during standard working hours leading up to July 23.\n  - Existing Prometheus/Grafana access is working (based on previous workshops).\n- Buffer built in: last 24h reserved for packaging & distribution only—no new analysis should happen then.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Quick Visual Summary\n**T-13 days (Today) → T-1 day:**  \n- Jul 10–12: Gather resources, confirm roles, validate tech ⚙  \n- Jul 14–16: Draft agenda narrative & prep dashboards/slides 📝  \n- Jul 18–19: Dry run + metrics validation ✅  \n- Jul 22: Send final pre-reads + reminder mail 📤  \n- Jul 23: Deliver meeting smoothly 🎯  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate this as a ready-to-share timeline PDF** or **create a Teams task list (Microsoft Planner) for each action item and assign owners automatically**?",

Review canary metrics vs thresholds (cold-start ≤900ms, warm-start ≤130ms, memory ≤200MB)\n  2. Analyze Prometheus/Grafana alerts (latency spikes, memory breaches, circuit breaker state)\n  3. Postmortem on rollback: timing, root cause, mitigation\n  4. Define action items: alert tuning, Jenkins job improvements, docs update\n- **Attachments:** v2.1.0_Canary_Postmortem.pdf (in meeting invite)\n- **Current date/time:** **July 10, 2025 @ 01:00 (UTC+8)** ≈ July 9, 2025, 10:00 PDT\n- **Time until meeting:** ~14 calendar days\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Overall Approach\nWe have **2 weeks** to prepare. Focus on:\n- Validating and consolidating **metrics and incident data** for the rollback\n- Reviewing dashboards and alert rules (Prometheus, Grafana)\n- Pre-read materials distribution\n- Dry-run with core engineering to validate findings\n\n---\n\n# 📅 WORKBACK PLAN (Starting from Meeting Date → Today)\n### **Meeting Date:** Wednesday, **July 23, 2025 @ 17:00 PDT**\n\n---\n\n## **Final Prep (Day of Meeting)**\n| **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes** |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Upload final deck & doc links to Teams meeting chat | **July 23, 10:00 PDT** | Wilford | Include v2.1.0_Canary_Postmortem.pdf, Grafana snapshot URLs |\n| Confirm fallback for Teams screen share/demo | **July 23, 10:00 PDT** | Danille | Test screen share of Financial-Workflow-Metrics dashboard |\n\n---\n\n## **T-1 Day (July 22)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Distribute **pre-read packet** via email/Teams (postmortem doc + dashboards) | **July 22, 12:00 PDT** | Sau | Include summary table: cold vs warm start latency, memory usage, any rollback trigger points |\n| Finalize agenda in invite body | **July 22, 12:00 PDT** | Wilford | Double-check discussion order & time allocations |\n\n---\n\n## **Dry Run & Alignment (T-2 Days)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Conduct **30-min dry run** with core presenters (Wilford, Sau, Bev) | **July 21, 14:00 PDT** | Wilford | Focus on timing and clarity of rollback timeline section |\n| Validate fallback plan for Grafana link permissions | **July 21** | Octavia | Ensure attendees have correct Grafana folder access |\n\n---\n\n## **Data Analysis Lockdown (T-4 to T-7 Days)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Freeze final metrics set for dashboard screenshots | **July 19** | Myles | Capture memory trends, latency heatmaps from production vs staging |\n| Review and confirm incident timeline (rollback initiation triggers) | **July 18** | Bev | Align with PagerDuty & Jenkins logs |\n\n---\n\n## **Agenda & Material Prep (T-8 to T-10 Days)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Create draft **deep-dive deck** using v2.1.0_Canary_Postmortem.pdf as base | **July 15** | Sau | Add sections on Prometheus queries + alert tuning proposals |\n| Update PromQL snippets & screenshot Grafana alert panels | **July 15** | Danille | Highlight redline thresholds & CB transition states |\n\n---\n\n## **Early Coordination & Logistics (This Week)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm attendee availability & set expectations | **July 12** | Wilford | Include Teams link verification |\n| Identify any high-risk data gathering blockers | **July 12** | Sau | Escalate missing logs or alert correlation issues |\n\n---\n\n# ✅ PHASE SUMMARY\n**Phase 1 (Now → July 12):** Coordination, lock attendee availability, identify blockers\n**Phase 2 (July 13 → 19):** Data consolidation & deck drafting\n**Phase 3 (July 20 → 22):** Dry run, finalize materials, distribute pre-read\n**Phase 4 (July 23):** Meeting day execution\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Assumptions & Risks\n- Assumes **Prometheus and Grafana alert data** is accessible to Myles & Danille by July 15; delays impact dry run quality\n- Attendees’ time zone: Mostly PDT; adjust if remote folks join\n- No overlapping major release freeze (verify with EngOps calendar)\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Would you like me to:\n1. **Generate an editable timeline (Gantt-style table)** for this plan (perfect for Confluence/Teams)?\n2. **Prepare a pre-read packet structure template** (including suggested content outline for postmortem slides)?\n3. **Create a checklist** of roles and linked docs (Grafana dashboards, PromQL alert rules, PDF)?\n\nWhich of these should I deliver next?", "assertions":

meeting agenda | Jul 16 | Shakia | Send early email with working draft of guide and outline of tasks required before session. |\n| Confirm **attendee availability & any agenda additions** | Jul 15 | Shakia | Ensure all key SMEs (Wilford, Bev, Porsha) can attend; lock agenda topics. |\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Assumptions & Risks\n- **Meeting date confirmed:** July 28 from the event object.  \n- Attachments are pre-created and ready for review (validated in grounding data).  \n- Owners inferred from agenda roles and organizational context; if workload shifts occur, adjust ownership.  \n- Buffer built-in: Last dry run is 3 days before session to allow fixes.  \n- If dependencies (like PR merge) slip, instruct fallback to live branch demo and note in agenda.  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ Quick Summary of Key Deliverables\n- **By Jul 16:** Initial agenda + working doc shared  \n- **By Jul 18:** Core PR finalized  \n- **By Jul 21–24:** Parameter review, dashboard validation, runbook updates done  \n- **By Jul 25:** Final agenda + dry run complete  \n- **Jul 28:** Ready-to-execute session with validated materials and dashboards  \n\n---\n\n👉 Would you like me to **also generate an email draft to attendees** outlining this timeline and linking pre-reading materials (`JWT_Cache_Dynamic_Resizing_Guide.docx` & PR URLs)?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text":

confirm all attendees online at 14:00 PST.\n\n---\n\n#### **T-Minus 1 Day (July 27)**\n- **Dry-Run / Tech Check**  \n  **Owner:** Wilford  \n  **Notes:**  \n    - Validate Prometheus & Grafana panels for JWT cache metrics.  \n    - Confirm screen share readiness for deck and YAML samples.\n\n- **Finalize Deck Updates**  \n  **Owner:** Shakia  \n  **Notes:** Include latest schema diagrams, dashboard screenshots, and summarized load test plan in **JWT_Cache_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx**.\n\n---\n\n#### **T-Minus 3 Days (July 25)**  \n- **Runbook Draft Update**  \n  **Owner:** Bev Mcginty  \n  **Notes:** Add **thrash warning checks** and **dynamic resizing alert steps** per architecture guide.  \n\n- **Load Test Plan Sign-off**  \n  **Owner:** Porsha Brodbeck  \n  **Notes:** Define RPS tiers, rotation scenarios, and JMeter/Locust configs; confirm staging environment availability.  \n\n---\n\n#### **T-Minus 1 Week (July 21)**  \n- **Collect Dashboard Review Feedback**  \n  **Owner:** Wilford Taussig  \n  **Notes:** Integrate any comments on metric panels (cache hit ratio, eviction count, latency under key rotation).\n\n- **YAML Schema Finalization**  \n  **Owner:** Bev Mcginty  \n  **Notes:** Freeze `cache_settings.yaml` structure for PR walkthrough; ensure lint pass in CI.  \n\n---\n\n#### **T-Minus 10 Days (July 18)**  \n- **PR Review Prep for `cache_manager` Dynamic Logic**  \n  **Owner:** Shakia  \n  **Notes:** Highlight parameter tuning and hot reload strategy in Notes for reviewers;

Pull references from Confluence vault-integration notes. |\n| Identify core attendees & confirm invites | **Jul 22** | Jason Adon | Cross-check with DevOps & Security leads (e.g., Terina Hafen from feature flag retro). Ensure stakeholders for Vault rotation policy & CI/CD pipeline present. |\n| Create meeting calendar invite with Teams link | **Jul 22** | Jason Adon | Update agenda in invite once draft is ready. |\n\n---\n\n### **Collaboration Phase (4–3 Days Before)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Circulate draft agenda for feedback to attendees | **Jul 24 (Thu)** | Jason Adon | Allow 24hrs for comments. Annotate high-impact sections (HMAC signing logic, Vault failover strategy). |\n| Gather supporting artifacts (logs, pipeline configs, previous PR diffs) | **Jul 24** | TBD (DevOps/Infra) | Pull configs referenced in **July 14 chat**: Vault API key fetch mechanism, rollback scripts. Include recent Opsgenie alert integration (see prev retro discussions). |\n\n---\n\n### **Finalization Phase (2–1 Day Before)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Finalize agenda & distribute pre-read packet | **Jul 25 (Fri)** | Jason Adon | Pre-read may include: Vault integration flow diagram, security checklist, hmac-signature spec, rollback runbook excerpt. |\n| Validate tech setup (Teams meeting link, screen share, recordings enabled) | **Jul 25** | Jason Adon | Confirm permissions for remote participants. |\n| Confirm action items tracking template | **Jul 25** | Jason Adon | Prepare shared doc for capturing retro outputs and assigning owners. |\n\n---\n\n### **Day-of Prep**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Join early and test screen share | **Jul 28, 09:45 AM PST** | Jason Adon | Keep hmac/signature reference snippet and Vault client diagrams handy. |\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Key Dependencies & Risks\n- **Dependencies:**  \n    - Vault config details consolidated (DevOps confirmation).  \n    - Security policy reference (PCI/HMAC) from prior pipeline docs.\n- **Risks:**  \n    - Tight turnaround for pre-read if feedback cycle delays occur → Mitigation: circulate draft **no later than Jul 24**.\n\n---\n\n## **Assumptions**\n- Meeting details confirmed from event entity: date/time accurate.  \n- Attendee list inferred from context (Terina, security/DevOps leads)—must validate via calendar before Jul 22.  \n- Agenda will cover Vault rotation, rollback, and CI/CD pipeline tie-ins because of prior thread context (no explicit agenda in grounding data).  \n\n---\n\n# ✅ Summary Timeline\n- **Jul 22:** Agenda drafted & invites confirmed.  \n- **Jul 24:** Agenda circulated; pre-read materials gathered.  \n- **Jul 25:** Pre-read distributed; tech setup validated.  \n- **Jul 28, 09:45 AM PST:** Final prep before retrospective.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **prepare a detailed agenda draft framework for Vault Integration Retrospective** (e.g., sections like “Integration Challenges,” “Security Review,” “Actionable Next Steps”)?  \nOr should I also **compile a pre-read packet outline referencing related artifacts and security guidelines**?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text":

Review Jenkins shared library enhancements (`AnomalyRulesDeploy`, schema-validation gate).\n2. Summarize performance and security gate results (from recent smoke tests and fault injection analysis).\n3. Confirm rollout readiness and address open action items before production freeze.\n4. Align on next steps for Confluence documentation and any remaining automation tasks.\n\n---\n\n# 📋 **Workback Plan: Jenkins Pipeline Deep Dive (Meeting Date: 2025-07-21 09:00 UTC)**\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Preparation (Tonight – July 20)**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| **1. Collect & refine core presentation deck** | **July 20, 18:30 UTC** | Markita | Use `fraud_detection_pipeline_deep_dive_detailed.pptx` as base. Ensure slides on: <br>• Jenkins validation gate sequence <br>• Schema gate fault-injection outcome <br>• Metrics from Snyk & security-policies enforcement |\n| **2. Validate latest PR & merge status** | **July 20, 19:00 UTC** | Danille | Confirm `feature/fraud-config` merge completed (GitHub PR #123). Reference XLS action sheet & fraud_config_smoke_test_report.pdf. |\n| **3. Compile updated metrics for discussion** | **July 20, 19:30 UTC** | Bev (or Markita if Bev unavailable) | Use logs from yesterday’s vacuum simulation runs and security gate pass metrics. Summarize in 3 bullet points for slide 3. |\n| **4. Prepare curated artifact links** | **July 20, 20:00 UTC** | Markita | Gather Confluence links, Jenkins job URL, GitHub PR refs for quick access during call. Share in chat with Danille. |\n\n*(Buffer: 1 hour for unexpected blockers — complete all by 21:00 UTC)*\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Meeting Readiness (Early AM – July 21)**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| **5. Dry-run presentation internally** | **July 21, 06:30 UTC** | Markita | 15-min internal check. Focus on: <br>• Narrative flow <br>• Visual correctness (diagrams, metrics). |\n| **6. Confirm meeting platform & access** | **July 21, 07:30 UTC** | Markita | Validate virtual link works; share reminder via Teams to Danille. |\n| **7. Final transfer of metrics snapshot** | **July 21, 08:00 UTC** | Danille | Drop final Jenkins run metrics & schema-validation screenshots in shared folder by 1 hour pre-call. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Execution + Follow-up**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| **8.

Summarize outcomes in Confluence** | **July 21, 11:30 UTC** | Markita | Include: key decisions, validated pipeline gating steps, updated timelines. |\n| **10. Trigger follow-up actions** | **July 21, EOD UTC** | Markita | Create Jira tasks for any gating fixes, CI adjustments, or rollout blockers raised. |\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 **Dependencies & Critical Notes**\n- Dependencies:\n  - Recent smoke test report (`fraud_config_smoke_test_report.pdf`) needs to be validated for schema-gate pass/fail summary.\n  - Confirm meeting metrics reflect newest regex compliance and Jenkins stage timings.\n- This is a **tight timeline**: No room for long iterations → sync async via Teams/Slack tonight.\n- Attach `fraud_detection_pipeline_deep_dive_detailed.pptx` in invite for Danille’s preview.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation\n- **Risk:** Presentation incomplete before 21:00 UTC.  \n  *Mitigation:* Allocate focused 90-min block tonight; skip low-priority cosmetic edits.\n- **Risk:** Metrics refresh delayed.  \n  *Mitigation:* Use latest stable Jenkins runs in case final pass fails.\n- **Risk:** Meeting runs over.  \n  *Mitigation:* Share pre-read deck + key metrics link to Danille in advance.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Assumptions\n- Meeting start (2025-07-21 09:00 UTC) confirmed via Event entity.\n- One-on-one focus; minimal coordination overhead.\n- PR merge completion is near-complete per status from XLS and chat context.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Timeline Snapshot**\n\n| Date & Time (UTC) | Task |\n|--------------------|------|\n| July 20 18:30 | Refine

Interactive lab updating onboarding test suites (UserProfileControllerTest, TransactionServiceTest)  \n- **Related Attachment:** `Advanced_JUnit_Parametrization_and_RSD_Traceability_Guide.pdf`  \n- **Current Date/Time:** **July 25, 2025 22:00 +08:00 (~July 25 14:00 UTC)**  \n  → **Time until session:** ~2.5 days (including weekend buffer).\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Assumptions\n- No conflicting calendar items were found for July 28.\n- Owners based on roles in grounding data (e.g., CI/CD tasks → Tisa, traceability → Saturnina, QA tasks → Ashley).\n- All prep will happen remotely via Teams; no physical logistics needed.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Workback Timeline (Meeting: **Mon, July 28 @ 14:00 UTC**)\n\n| Phase | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Phase 1: Prep & Alignment** |\n| Kick-off prep sync (optional) | **July 26 (Sat)** | Saturnina | Quick Teams huddle w/ Tisa & Shari to confirm progress checkpoints. Aggressive because weekend buffer is slim; optional but recommended. |\n| Confirm all attendees & send agenda reminder | **July 26 (Sat)** | Shari | Include Teams link & attachment (`Advanced_JUnit_Parametrization_and_RSD_Traceability_Guide.pdf`) |\n| **Phase 2: Materials & Technical Setup** |\n| Finalize workshop deck & lab flow using agenda topics | **July 27 (Sun)** | Shari | Ensure slides reference YAML scenario mapping & Jenkins pipeline snippet (`coverage.groovy`, RSD compliance steps) |\n| Validate supporting assets: `onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml` + related test fixtures | **July 27 (Sun)** | Jason & Ashley | Cross-check YAML covers edge cases: null timestamps, leap second, invalidUserId |\n| Prepare Jenkins pipeline snippet for CI demo (matrix + failFast:false + `rsdComplianceCheck`) | **July 27 (Sun)** | Tisa | Confirm artifact paths: `/traceability/${BUILD_ID}` match team convention |\n| **Phase 3: Pre-Reads & Dry Run** |\n| Distribute pre-read package: Slide deck + `Advanced_JUnit_Parametrization_and_RSD_Traceability_Guide.pdf` + code snippets | **July 27 (Sun) EOD** | Shari | Post to Teams channel & email |\n| Dry run lab exercise: Extend `UserProfileControllerTest` & `TransactionServiceTest` with new @ParameterizedTest using `MethodSource` | **July 28 (Mon) 09:00 UTC** | Ashley & Jason | Validate local runtime; confirm assertions & coverage thresholds (≥90%) |\n| Confirm RSD traceability artifact generation works in staging build | **July 28 (Mon) 09:00 UTC** | Tisa | Validate compliance report in `traceabilityReportDir`; ensure unique complianceID logged |\n| **Final Sweep Before Session** |\n| Check Teams meeting link, screen-share, demo accounts | **July 28 (Mon) 12:00 UTC** | Saturnina | Ensure pipeline snippet & YAML files accessible |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Key Dependencies\n- Lab exercise depends on `onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml` + updated pipeline steps being ready by **July 27 EOD**.\n- Materials for attendees (deck + guide PDF) should go out at least 18–24h prior for meaningful review.\n- CI/CD snippet verification and RSD compliance check **must** pass before demo; if failing, fallback plan = run from local Jenkins sandbox instance.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Risks & Mitigation\n- **Tight weekend window:** If prep slips, critical tasks (deck finalization, pre-read distribution) must still happen by Sunday night UTC.\n- **Pipeline failure on RSD compliance:** Prepare backup screenshots of compliance artifact folder & Prometheus dashboard for lab discussion.\n- **Coverage gating flakiness:** Override `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` on develop branch as temporary safeguard, per prior Onboarding Test planning doc.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠 Reference Artifacts for Prep\n- **Slide Deck:** `Advanced_JUnit_Parametrization_and_RSD_Traceability_Guide.pdf`\n- **Previous Guides:** `Onboarding_Unit_Test_Workshop_Planning_Document.pdf`, `Onboarding_Error_Handling_Guide.docx`\n- **Pipeline Hooks:** CI patch per email “Automated: CI Pipeline Aggregator & RSD Compliance Artifact Summary” (includes aggregator diff)\n- **Traceability Schema:** compliance_traceability_definition.json sample (from Shari’s email)\n\n---\n\n✅ This plan gives each owner clear deliverables and deadlines, ensuring the July 28 session is productive and risk-free.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a one-page visual timeline (Gantt-style) PDF** for this workback plan or **prepare an email draft to share with attendees including these key dates

Custom `MethodSource` providers and YAML-driven scenario mapping  \n2. Test fixture versioning (`onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml`)  \n3. Jenkins integration: failFast flags, matrix parallelism, JUnit XML aggregation, RSD compliance check  \n4. Artifact path conventions and `traceabilityReportDir` usage  \n5. Interactive lab exercises extending `UserProfileControllerTest` & `TransactionServiceTest`\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Time until meeting: **7 days** (Current time: July 21, 2025)\n\n---\n\n## **Workback Timeline**\n\n### **Phase 1: Early Prep (Today – July 23)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| ✅ Confirm meeting objectives & attendee roles | **Jul 22** | Saturnina Soyke | Align on interactive goals; clarify lab expectations for QA (Ashley) & DevOps (Tisa). |\n| ✅ Review provided deck (*Advanced_JUnit_Parametrization_and_RSD_Traceability_Guide.pdf*) | **Jul 22** | All attendees | Ensure familiarity with Parameterized Tests & RSD integration concepts. |\n| ✅ Gather pipeline references | **Jul 23** | Tisa Odonoghue | Use *Jenkinsfile.security.groovy* and prior CI/CD deep-dive slides for insight (artifact paths, JUnit aggregation). |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Material Finalization (July 24–26)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft YAML-driven scenario mapping examples (e.g., `onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml`) | **Jul 24** | Jason Adon | Create 2–3 onboarding negative test cases with clear RSD linkage. |\n| Prepare updated JUnit test templates (`UserProfileControllerTest`, `TransactionServiceTest`) | **Jul 24** | Ashley Engel | Must include `@MethodSource` and edge-case assertions. |\n| Verify RSD compliance hooks & `traceabilityReportDir` path | **Jul 25** | Tisa Odonoghue | Align with CI pipeline spec; confirm artifact aggregation logic matches engineering docs. |\n| Validate Jenkins failFast + matrix config for parameterized suites | **Jul 25** | Saturnina Soyke + Tisa | Reference Jenkinsfile patterns from recent workshops (*CI-CD_Pipeline_Deep_Dive_Secure_Resiliency.pptx*). |\n| Consolidate lab instructions & code snippets into final guide | **Jul 26** | Shari Jatho | Combine from draft deck plus YAML + JUnit examples; upload to Teams folder. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Dry Run & Distribution (July 27)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Conduct internal dry run | **Jul 27 AM UTC** | Saturnina Soyke + Shari | Test deck flow + lab steps in a mock environment. Timebox: 90 mins. |\n| Distribute final pre-read & repo links to attendees | **Jul 27 EOD UTC** | Shari Jatho | Share via Teams & email; include instructions for local setup and dependencies. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Day-of Checklist (July 28)**  \n| Task | Time | Owner | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Validate Teams meeting link and screen share | **+2 hrs before** | Shari Jatho | Confirm no access issues. |\n| Push updated test fixtures to `test-resources` branch | **+1 hr before** | Ashley Engel | Ensure everyone can pull latest before session. |\n| Open monitoring dashboards (if demoing CI hooks live) | **+30 min before** | Tisa Odonoghue | Use pipeline staging job for real-time XML aggregation view. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Dependencies & Risk Mitigation\n- **Dependencies:**  \n  - JUnit param examples depend on Jason/Ashley delivering fixtures & templates.  \n  - Jenkins integration review depends on Tisa pulling latest security-gated Jenkinsfile and matrix configs.  \n- **Risks & Mitigations:**  \n  - **Tight turnaround** for YAML mappings → prep basic skeleton by Jul 23 to unblock test authors.  \n  - **Lab readiness** depends on access to CI environment → confirm with infra team by Jul 25.  \n  - **Fallback:** If CI demo fails, switch to pre-recorded session from *Performance_Graphs_DeepDive.pdf* for visual continuity.  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Assumptions\n- All attendees have access to shared engineering documents and prior CI/CD artifacts (confirmed via previous workshops).\n- Meeting date/time assumed correct from calendar event: **July 28, 2025 @ 14:00–17:00 UTC**.\n- Current time is **July 21, 2025 22:00 +08:00**; timeline reflects 7-day prep window.\n\n---\n\n### 🔗 Key References for Prep:\n- 📄 *Advanced_JUnit_Parametrization_and_RSD_Traceability_Guide.pdf* (attached in meeting invite)\n- 📄 *CI-CD_Pipeline_Deep_Dive_Secure_Resiliency.pptx* for Jenkins pipeline patterns  \n- 📄 *Microservices_Architecture_Deep_Dive.pptx* for test coverage and artifact flow context  \n\n---\n\n✅ **Next Step for You:**  \nConfirm attendee prep responsibilities and set a quick sync by **July 22** to align on YAML and test coverage strategy.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **auto-create a Teams task list** for these milestones and push reminders to attendees?  \n*(This will ensure nothing falls through the cracks.)*", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should include a backward timeline from T₀ with dependency-aware sequencing",

(From Provided Data):**\n- **Meeting Name:** OTLP Dynamic Batch Sizing Algorithm Review  \n- **Date & Time:** **August 5, 2025, 09:00–09:30 PDT** (30-minute session)  \n- **Organizer:** Emory Scherping  \n- **Attendees (Required):**  \n  • Emory Scherping (DevOps Engineer)  \n  • Danille Ciardullo (DevOps Engineer)  \n- **Location:** Microsoft Teams (link provided in calendar event)  \n- **Objective (Inferred from title):** Review the OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) dynamic batch sizing algorithm design, trade-offs, and implementation considerations.  \n- **Attachments:** No attached files found in grounding data.  \n- **Current Time:** July 22, 2025, 17:00 (+08:00) → ~**13 days until the meeting**.  \n\n---\n\n## **Assumptions & Notes**\n- No explicit agenda document exists yet → will be created as part of this plan.\n- Purpose: Deep technical discussion; likely requires pre-read material on algorithm design, performance metrics, and trade-offs similar to previous infra-focused sessions.\n- Participants are technical; minimal stakeholder overhead but still need alignment (agenda + slides).\n- No external dependencies indicated; internal resources available.\n- Working days assumed: July 23 onward; weekends excluded unless buffer noted.\n\n---\n\n## **Workback Timeline**\n\n### **Phase 1 – Preparation & Context Gathering**  \n| Date        | Task

|\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Jul 24 (Thu)** | Collect background docs & metrics relevant to OTLP batching algorithm (e.g., performance benchmarks, current Jenkins/Telemetry results) | Emory         | Start from files in EngineeringDocuments (check ShardTestStrategy.xlsx, Performance specs for previous sessions). |\n| **Jul 25 (Fri)** | Define preliminary agenda framework (objectives, key discussion points, time allocations) | Emory         | Reference structure used in “Feature Flag Infrastructure” deep dives for consistency. |\n\n### **Phase 2 – Drafting & Alignment**  \n| Date        | Task                                                      | Owner           |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| **Jul 28 (Mon)** | Circulate **draft agenda** to Danille for input & additional topics | Emory           |\n| **Jul 29 (Tue)** | Pull relevant diagrams or pseudocode for OTLP algorithm trade-offs (sharding logic? batching heuristics?) | Danille        |\n\n### **Phase 3 – Finalization of Pre-Reads & Logistics**  \n| Date        | Task                                                 | Owner          |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **Jul 31 (Thu)** | Finalize **agenda** & upload pre-read doc with background + key questions | Emory          |\n| **Aug 1 (Fri)** | Finalize any supporting slides (if needed) – keep lightweight | Emory & Danille|\n\n### **Phase 4 – Pre-Meeting Readiness & Dry Run**\n| Date        | Task                                                        | Owner |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| **Aug 4 (Mon)** | Send **final reminder** with Teams link & agenda; reattach pre-reads | Emory |\n| **Aug 4 (Mon)** | Quick **tech check** – confirm Teams screen-share works, no firewall issues | Emory |\n\n### **Meeting Day**  \n| Date        | Task                                    | Owner |\n|------------|----------------------------------------|-------|\n| **Aug 5 (Tue)** | Host review session: 09:00–09:30 PDT | Emory |\n\n## **Key Dependencies & Risks**\n- **Dependencies:** Timely review by Danille to avoid late changes; availability of historical performance data.\n- **Risks:** Limited time for experimentation; buffer built by ensuring agenda finalization by July 31.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Next Action (Immediate):**  Begin gathering algorithm design references & pipeline metrics analysis by **July 24** and draft agenda by **July 25**.\n\n---",

Emit Prometheus metrics for latency; verify Chaos Monkey pods autoscale correctly. |\n| Prepare talking points & embed snippet excerpts into Teams agenda | Jul 27 12:00 | Danille | Pull Groovy snippet from shared Jenkins library draft and YAML snippet from `Chaos_Resource_Autoscaling_Guide.docx`. Add to pre-read deck for easy screen share. |\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 3: Pre-Read Distribution & Jenkins Snippet Drafting (Jul 26)**  \n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Finalize Jenkins pipeline snippet for HPA integration | **Jul 26 EOD** | Danille | Base on agenda #3: include MAX_PARALLEL_CHAOS_PODS as reference pattern from `QA_Playbook_Chaos_Section.docx`; inject HPA params via env mapping. |\n| Validate `Chaos_Resource_Autoscaling_Guide.docx` alignment | Jul 26 | Emory | Highlight target CPU utilization=50%, check 600m/512Mi resource constraints, YAML metrics block correctness. |\n| Distribute pre-read (Guide + snippet screenshot) via email/Teams | Jul 26 | Danille | Use attachment link from EngineeringDocuments; confirm Emory has access. |\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 4: Early Prep & Infra Checkpoints (Jul 25)**  \n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Confirm cluster readiness for HPA tests | **Jul 25 PM** | Emory | Ensure metrics-server running, Prometheus scrape configs include HPA metrics, RBAC roles in place for autoscaler. |\n| Draft deck skeleton for deep dive | Jul 25 | Danille | One-slide overview of current autoscaling gaps, one for Jenkins pipeline flow diagram. Use style from `Compliance_Enforcement_DeepDive.pptx` and `FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx` as reference. |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Dependencies & Risk Mitigation**\n- Jenkins snippet completion (**Danille**) → prerequisite for dry-run & meeting discussion.\n- Prometheus connectivity for autoscaler metrics → flagged as high-risk; buffer half-day (Jul 25) for fixes.\n- Book 30-min buffer before meeting for last-minute alignment in case HPA script fails scaling simulation.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Assumptions**\n- Meeting slot (Jul 27 @17:00 PDT) stays fixed. *(If rescheduled, this workback must shift accordingly.)*  \n- Current user (Emory) has Kubernetes cluster + Jenkins pipeline access.  \n- No major resource constraints on staging cluster over the weekend (Jul 26–27).  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Summary View**\n**Jul 25 (Fri):** Infra readiness check + draft deep dive slides  \n**Jul 26 (Sat):** Jenkins HPA snippet finalized, validate guide, distribute pre-read  \n**Jul 27 (Sun):** Dry-run validation AM → Meeting prep mid-day → Deep Dive @17:00  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **auto-generate a shareable checklist (Markdown or Excel)** for this timeline **or draft the Jenkins snippet skeleton** (`parameters {...}` + `kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml`) based on our pipeline

Confirm meeting logistics & Teams link accessibility                 | Danille      | Check calendar invite includes correct link; adjust time zones        |\n| Jul 21     | Identify supporting files and upload draft Jenkins snippet folder      | Danille      | Use internal repo; branch name: feature/HPA-autoscaling              |\n| Jul 21     | Validate **Chaos_Resource_Autoscaling_Guide.docx** contents are complete | Emory        | Ensure all key metrics referenced in agenda exist in doc             |\n\n---\n\n## **Plan Assumptions & Risks**\n- **Assumption:** Meeting date/time (July 27) and agenda are correct as per event grounding data.  \n- Owners based on roles: Danille (organizer/DevOps), Emory (peer for technical validation).  \n- No external dependencies mentioned; all work is internal.  \n- Risk: Tight turnaround for snippet integration if Jenkins library dependencies break; mitigation → complete initial draft by **Jul 24** to allow buffer.  \n\n---\n\n## **At-a-Glance Timeline**\n- **Today (Jul 21):** Logistics + confirm pre-read sources  \n- **Midweek (Jul 23–24):** Agenda finalization + YAML & pipeline draft complete  \n- **Day Before (Jul 26):** Dry run + share final deck  \n- **Jul 27:** Deliver session  \n\n---\n\n✅ This plan ensures **agenda readiness**, **artifact preparation**, and **logistics confirmation** well before the meeting date, using realistic buffers given the 7-day horizon.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Step**\nWould you like me to **draft the pre-read package summary** (including highlights from *Chaos_Resource_Autoscaling_Guide.docx* and

Collect prior pain points** | Jul 30, 11:00 | Miss Bjorkman | From July 23 Chat: caching Go modules (`go mod download` layer), `GOCACHE` mount issues, SonarQube sync timing. |\n| **8. Sync with Sonar dashboard** *(Optional but Recommended)* | Jul 30, 12:00 | Miss Bjorkman | Snapshot current coverage metrics for Go services → helps illustrate gains or gaps. |\n\n---\n\n### **Logistics & Contingencies**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| **9. Verify Focus Room B availability** | Jul 29, confirm now | Danille | Event shows reserved; assume no conflict but double-check. |\n| **10. Prepare fallback link (Teams)** | Jul 30, 10:00 | Danille | In case local AV fails, share backup link from event body details. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Timeline Summary (Working Backward)\n**2025-07-30**\n- **14:00 PST** – Meeting starts  \n- **13:50 PST** – Arrive & setup  \n- **10:00 PST** – Verify pointers, finalize notes  \n- **09:30 PST** – Coverage CI command dry run  \n- **08:00 PST** – Annotate hygiene guide  \n\n**2025-07-29**\n- **EOD** – Agenda confirmed; final Qs prepared  \n- **Tonight (Post-request)** – Ensure file access & backup environment check  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Dependencies & Risks\n- **Dependencies:**  \n  - Access to `Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx` (confirmed)  \n  - Jenkins fragment snippet from `ci-retrofit-template.yml` (ready per chat)  \n- **Risks:**  \n  - Very tight prep window: ~31 hours; tasks marked for early morning completion  \n  - Internet outage or AV issues: Mitigation ≈ backup Teams link  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Next Step RIGHT NOW**\n- Confirm you can open `Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx` and highlight 3 key discussion areas.\n- Draft your top 3 questions from chat/email context (e.g., “How to enforce `--failfast` in shared CI template?”).\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ All Tasks Fit in: ~4 hrs prep over Jul 29 late AM PST + Jul 30 AM.\nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-share checklist PDF** (with deadlines + tick boxes) or a **color-coded Gantt-style workback timeline** you can circulate to Danille for visibility?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should

Highlight questions. |\n| Pull **recent Go service PRs/tests** to identify current gaps | **Thu, Jul 24** | Miss Bjorkman | Focus on coverage shortfalls and non-standard mocking patterns. |\n| Collect benchmarking metrics **from SonarQube** (coverage %) | **Fri, Jul 25** | Miss Bjorkman | Helps align conversation on enforcing coverage thresholds (from 82% → target 85%+). |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Draft Inputs & Align with Organizer**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft **example table-driven tests** and **mock usage issues** to bring up in meeting | **Mon, Jul 28 (Morning)** | Miss Bjorkman | Include at least 1 case of testify misusage and 1 code snippet for mockery automation discussion. |\n| Confirm meeting agenda items with Danille via quick **Teams chat or email** | **Mon, Jul 28 (EOD)** | Miss Bjorkman | Verify if anything changed beyond agenda (e.g., SonarQube config or contribution guide updates). |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Logistics & Finalization**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Finalize **preparation notes & questions** | **Tue, Jul 29 (EOD)** | Miss Bjorkman | Align examples to attached doc’s standards. Prioritize discussion points (mocking best practices, CI coverage gates). |\n| Print or bookmark `Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx` for reference | **Tue, Jul 29** | Miss Bjorkman | Bring annotated remarks if local review is easier. |\n| Verify meeting location and physical access (Focus Room B) | **Morning of Wed, Jul 30** | Miss Bjorkman | Allow for parking/security buffer. Bring laptop for live demo if needed. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Additional Notes / Assumptions\n- **Assumption:** No additional pre-read beyond `Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx`.  \n- If Danille expects updated examples pushed to GitHub, confirm by **July 28**.  \n- If constraints arise (e.g., last-minute high-priority tasks), push non-critical steps forward but keep **example prep by Jul 29** at latest.  \n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations\n- **Tight turnaround?** Keep Phase 1 lean: template review and service gap analysis first.  \n- **Location/tech risk:** Meeting is in-person. Carry laptop and power adapter. Room AV unlikely required, but check if HDMI needed for code walkthrough.  \n\n---\n\n✅ **This plan ensures you’re fully ready for a technical deep dive with actionable examples and agenda alignment,

immediately.\n- Owners are inferred from context:\n  - *Danille*: Organizer, DevOps champion, existing code/practice owner.\n  - *Miss*: Attendee, provides examples and feedback.\n- Any additional stakeholders (e.g., QA leads) are **not indicated in provided grounding**, so excluded.\n- No prior pre-read circulation confirmed → explicitly included as a milestone.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 **Workback Plan for July 30 Meeting**\n\n### **Phase 1: Preparation & Drafting**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Confirm agenda scope** (Test Hygiene best practices, coverage thresholds) | **July 18 (Fri)** | Danille | Align with meeting body text & attached template; confirm Miss’s focus areas. |\n| **Review latest `Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx`** | **July 18** | Miss | Skim for gaps; mark any questions on mocking or table-driven tests. |\n| **Identify current gaps in existing Go service tests** | **July 19 (Mon)** | Danille | Use SonarQube dashboards and existing CONTRIBUTING.md to mark missing conventions. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Material Development**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Draft updated test hygiene deck/snippets** | **July 22 (Tue)** | Danille | Pull from `Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx`; integrate current CI coverage gates and mockery generation commands. |\n| **Prepare illustrative examples from current codebase** | **July 22** | Miss | Select 1–2 real test files demonstrating good and bad patterns. |\n| **Validate consistency with CONTRIBUTING.md** | **July 23 (Wed)** | Danille | Confirm naming, table-driven structure, lint rules match documentation. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Peer Review & Distribution**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Send draft deck & updated hygiene template for Miss’s review** | **July 24 (Thu)** | Danille | Include agenda, goals, and link to attached doc in email. |\n| **Finalize materials based on Miss’s feedback** | **July 25 (Fri)** | Danille | Apply any corrections; confirm examples are clear. |\n| **Distribute final pre-read package** (deck + hygiene template) | **July 26 (Sat)** | Danille | Send via email/Teams to Miss; highlight key sections for review. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Logistics & Final Readiness**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Confirm room & tech setup** (Focus Room B) | **July 28 (Mon)** | Danille | Verify AV and IDE demo readiness if applicable. |\n| **Dry-run of demo snippets** (Go test examples) | **July 29 (Tue)** | Danille | Ensure code compiles; verify Mockery automation steps. |\n| **Meeting execution** | **July 30 at 14:00 PST** | Both | Bring annotated decks, code examples, and open Q&A topics. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Critical Dependencies**\n- Updating hygiene standards **depends on finalizing examples** (Miss input).\n- Pre-read distribution **cannot slip past July 26** to give Miss 2–3 days for review.\n- Room and tech confirmation **must occur before July 29 dry-run**.\n\n---\n\n### 🔗 **Related Reference Material**\n- **Attached to invite:** `Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx`\n- **Current CI integration (from previous workshops):** SonarQube quality gate enforcement & Coverage gating strategies (mentioned in Optimization Workshop docs).\n\n---\n\n## ✔ Recommended Next Action\n**Today (July 16 PST):**  \n- Danille: Email Miss to confirm agenda points and highlight attached template.\n- Schedule 30-min internal block on July 29 for dry-run.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ This plan is grounded entirely in verified enterprise data:\n- Meeting date, attendees, agenda → from Outlook Event data\n- Template name → from meeting attachment\n- CI/testing context → from historical workshop and doc attachments\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a calendar-ready checklist with reminders** (e.g., tasks auto-scheduled as Outlook events)

me make a workback plan for the upcoming meeting '1:1 Test Hygiene Deep Dive for Go Services'", "response": "Here’s a **comprehensive workback plan** for your requested meeting, based on the available enterprise data:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Meeting Details (Confirmed from Grounding Data)\n- **Meeting Title:** 1:1 Test Hygiene Deep Dive for Go Services  \n- **Scheduled Date & Time:** **July 30, 2025 @ 14:00 PST** *(from EventId: 17d1e0cf)*  \n- **Organizer:** Danille Ciardullo (lod_danillec)  \n- **Required Attendee:** Miss Bjorkman (you)  \n- **Location:** Elk Grove Office – Focus Room B  \n- **Meeting Purpose:** Review updated Go test hygiene workflows, including:\n  - `testify/mock` conventions\n  - Mockery generation automation\n  - Naming standards for table-driven tests\n  - Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` sections\n- **Attachment:** *Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx* (contains code snippets and best practices)\n- **Notes:** Bring examples/questions on mocking external dependencies and integrating SonarQube coverage thresholds\n\n**Current Time:** July 16, 2025 22:00 (+08:00) → *~13 calendar days until the meeting*  \n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Key Observations & Constraints\n- Lots of detail in the event body on what needs to be covered.\n- Time window is tight: 13 days, includes weekends.\n- You own preparation; Danille is likely owner for template and logistics.\n- This is a deep technical session → Expect tasks around: reading template, drafting discussion points, prepping examples, confirming infrastructure (if demos planned).\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Plan: 1:1 Test Hygiene Deep Dive for Go Services\n\n*(Meeting date: July 30, 2025)*\n\n| **Phase**       | **Task**                                                           | **Due Date**      | **Owner**           | **Notes / Dependencies** |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Preparation** | Review *Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx* fully                   | **July 22 (T-8d)** | Miss Bjorkman (You) | Template attached to event; identify unclear areas. |\n|                 | Identify gaps in existing Go test suite vs. template guidelines    | **July 24 (T-6d)** | Miss Bjorkman       | Check naming patterns, mocking approach; create bullet points. |\n|                 | Draft questions/examples for discussion (mocking ext deps, SonarQube) | **July 25 (T-5d)** | Miss Bjorkman       | Focus on issues in current CONTRIBUTING.md or pipeline. |\n| **Collaboration** | Confirm with Danille if any live demo environment is required    | **July 25 (T-5d)** | Miss Bjorkman       | Ping via Teams/email; verify if laptop setup or example repo needed. |\n|                 | If demo needed: validate Go environment & upgrade `mockery` tool to latest version | **July 26 (T-4d)** | Miss Bjorkman       | Ensure `mockery` binary on PATH; test generation locally. |\n| **Finalization**| Prepare a concise “Meeting Ready Notes” doc (agenda reflection + findings) | **July 28 (T-2d)** | Miss Bjorkman       | Summarize: what you’ve found, open questions, suggestions. |\n|                 | Send meeting readiness confirmation (email or Teams)               | **July 29 (T-1d)** | Miss Bjorkman       | Include doc link, mention readiness; gives organizer confidence. |\n| **Logistics**   | Re-confirm physical room booking and blockers                      | **July 29 (T-1d)** | Organizer (Danille) | Meeting states Room B; confirm no change. |\n| **Meeting Day** | Bring printed or digital notes; test laptop access to codebase    | **July 30**        | Miss Bjorkman       | Arrive early to Focus Room B; ensure Wi-Fi and editor ready. |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Additional Considerations & Assumptions:\n- **Assumption:** No formal dry run required since this is a 1:1 deep dive, not a live demo for large audience.\n- **Risk Mitigation:** If demo required and environment setup runs late, have backup slide/snippets from `Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx`.\n- **Dependencies:** Danille controls meeting logistics and may provide updated `CONTRIBUTING.md`; align early to avoid last-minute surprises.\n\n---\n\n### 🔗 Quick Access Links:\n- Attachment: *Go_Test_Hygiene_Template_v2.docx* (from EventId 17d1e0cf)\n- Meeting details: `Elk Grove Office – Focus Room B` on **July 30 @ 14:00 PST**\n\n---\n\n✅ **Next Step (Today):**  \nAcknowledge plan & block time in your calendar for:\n- Template deep-dive (July 22)\n- Question drafting & gap analysis (July 24–25)\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **(a)** turn this into a **shared checklist in Microsoft Planner**, **(b)** draft a Teams message to Danille to confirm demo requirements, or **(c)** create a

Review Jenkins `canary.groovy` rollback guard snippet (lines 45–60).  \n  2. Validate new `CanaryRollbackInitiated` metric and Prometheus scrape config.  \n  3. Tune PromQL expressions for rollback alerts.  \n  4. Plan Grafana dashboard integration for new metric.  \n  5. Next steps: finalize PRs, assign JIRA tickets, schedule dry run analysis.  \n- **Scheduled Date:** *2025-06-20 at 11:00 UTC (30 min duration)*  \n- **Current Time:** *2025-06-13 at 19:00 +08:00 (which is 11:00 UTC)*  \n  → That means **7 calendar days remain** until the meeting.  \n- **Organizer:** Shakia Gencarelli (you)  \n- **Required Attendees:** Shakia Gencarelli, Wilford Taussig  \n- **Format:** Online (Teams link provided)  \n- **Related Grounding Resource:**  \n  - *Optimization_Workshop_Planning_Document.docx* (not directly about canary rollback but good reference for how engineering sessions are structured—objectives, validation, next steps).\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Observations / Constraints  \n- Tight timeline: only **1 week** to prepare. Tasks must be front-loaded.  \n- Deep-dive content is technical; prep materials, code snippet highlights, and metric configs must be easily reviewable before meeting.  \n- Attendees are both engineering roles: expect heavy technical discussion, no external stakeholder overhead.  \n- Meeting goal is refinement and finalization of rollback metric logic → need working code context, Prometheus expressions, and Grafana integration steps ready.  \n\n---\n\n## 📅 **Workback Plan for “Canary Pipeline Rollback Metrics Deep Dive” (Meeting Date: June 20, 2025)**\n\n| **Phase**              | **Task**                                                                         | **Due Date**   | **Owner**               | **Notes / Dependencies**                                                                           |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Phase 1: Prep & Context Alignment** | Confirm agenda with Wilford and ensure shared access to code and dashboards.            | June 14 (Fri) | Shakia Gencarelli       | Confirm Teams link works; verify access to Jenkins scripts and Grafana environment.               |\n|                        | Extract key code snippets for review (Jenkins `canary.groovy` lines 45-60).      | June 15 (Sat) | Shakia Gencarelli       | Provide annotated snippet highlighting rollback guard clause and edge cases.                      |\n|                        | Gather Prometheus scrape config and latest metric definitions for review.        | June 15 (Sat) | Wilford Taussig          | Required for tuning PromQL later.                                                                 |\n| **Phase 2: Material Preparation**     | Prepare draft **pre-read doc** (agenda, code excerpts, current metric implementation, sample PromQL queries). | June 16 (Mon) | Shakia Gencarelli       | Share in OneDrive/Teams; keep concise (1–2 pages).                                                |\n|                        | Validate Jenkins/Prometheus/Grafana environments are ready (no broken configs).  | June 16 (Mon) | Wilford Taussig          | Any outstanding infra issues resolved prior to meeting; dry-check configs.                        |\n| **Phase 3: Review & Iteration**       | Circulate pre-read to attendee(s) with expectations: review code, metrics strategy.    | June 17 (Tue) | Shakia Gencarelli       | Give at least 48 hrs for review before meeting.                                                   |\n|                        | Optional quick sync (15 min) to clarify any blockers/questions before final meeting. | June 18 (Wed) | Shakia & Wilford        | Keeps final session focused on decisions, not info-gathering.                                     |\n| **Phase 4: Finalization**             | Validate pre-read feedback and update discussion prompts.                               | June 19 (Thu) | Shakia Gencarelli       | Ensure agenda covers any new issues flagged during review.                                        |\n| **Meeting Day**                        | *Conduct Canary Pipeline Rollback Metrics Deep Dive.*                                  | June 20 (Fri) | All attendees            | Bring annotated code, metric definitions, and draft PromQL dashboard plan for final alignment.    |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Assumptions & Notes  \n- All prep files shared via existing LiveOak Teams channel or meeting chat (no explicit document mentioned for this meeting in grounding data).  \n- Owners inferred based on roles: you (Shakia) handle agenda/material prep; Wilford handles environment readiness and metric config details.  \n- *Optimization_Workshop_Planning_Document.docx* **was reviewed as process template inspiration only**, not meeting content dependency.  \n- Weekend (June 14-15) used for light prep given the compressed timeline; adjust if unavailable.  \n\n### 🔍 Risk Mitigation  \n- If Wilford is unavailable for pre-validation on metrics or Grafana, escalate early to ensure material completeness.  \n- If testing environments are flaky, have offline code excerpts and screenshots ready as backup for discussion.  \n\n---\n\n#### ⚡ Summary\nYou have **7 days**, so start with agenda confirmation and snippet extraction **tomorrow morning**, put the pre-read in circulation by **Monday**, and lock in a quick alignment by **Wednesday**. This ensures the actual deep dive on **Friday (June 20)** is efficient and decisive.\n\n---\n\n✅ Would you like me to **draft a one-page pre-read template** (with placeholders for code snippet, metric config, and PromQL examples) so you can populate content quickly?

Mitigation: use chat pings to follow up quickly.  \n\n---\n\n## Related Context from Data\n- **Relevant chat (HMAC signing guidance):** Key technical content for Vault integration; includes secrets path, cache strategy, signature generation procedure.  \n- **Design deck:** Contains API Gateway sequence diagram relevant for compliance integration with Vault rotation.  \n- **Prototype email:** Mahalanobis model results (not directly relevant for this meeting) – ignore for now.  \n\n---\n\n✅ **Action for you**:  \nStart with stakeholder confirmation and collect engineering updates today (Jul 18–19) to avoid slipping critical prep steps.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:  \n**(a)** Draft a quick **agenda outline with objectives and expected outcomes** for this meeting?  \n**(b)** Generate a

Pull context from recent scaling or resilience tasks if relevant. |\n| Collect recent scaling reports (CPU/Mem utilization trends) | **Jul 14 (Mon)** | Wilford | Extract from Prometheus/Grafana dashboards or related chaos metrics shared in `PaymentsAPI_Chaos_DeepMetrics.xlsx`—reuse observability context where applicable. |\n| Consolidate supporting artifacts | **Jul 14 (Mon)** | Ossie | Package existing threshold and pipeline adjustments from Planning Doc (`PaymentsAPI_Chaos_Sec_Assessment_2025-06_Planning.docx`) if they inform HPA tuning rationale. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Agenda & Pre-Read Finalization (T–3 to T–2 days)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Finalize detailed agenda with talking points | **Jul 15 (Tue)** | Ossie | Confirm sequence: 1) HPA metrics review, 2) Retry config discussion, 3) Open Q&A. Keep within 30-minute cap. |\n| Send agenda + pre-read packet to Wilford | **Jul 16 (Wed)** | Ossie | Include: finalized outline, linked docs/dashboards (esp. tuning experiences from chaos engineering). Use Teams or email. Ensure links to metrics dashboards and planning file are live and permissions OK. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Dry Run / Confirmation (T–1 day)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm technical setup (Teams meeting link active) | **Jul 18 (Fri)** | Ossie | Verify Wilford has access and connectivity (Teams). Double-check time zones—meeting is set for **15:00 UTC**. |\n| Optional quick sync or chat | **Jul 18 (Fri)** | Ossie & Wilford | Validate pre-read has been reviewed, confirm priority topics. |\n\n---\n\n### **Day of Meeting**\n| Task | Time | Owner | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Bring updated dashboards + retry policy reference | **Jul 19** | Ossie | Include any recent observations from auto-scaling telemetry since last chaos drills. |\n| Conduct session & capture decisions | **15:00 UTC** | Ossie (host) | Record action items and share summary within 24 hours. |\n\n---\n\n## **Post-Meeting Follow-up**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Share summary + action items | **Jul 20 (Sun)** | Ossie | Use Teams or email. Link to any updated docs/dashboards. Assign follow-up points (e.g., retry policy rollout, HPA YAML updates). |\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Assumptions & Risks**\n- No explicit pre-read is mentioned for this particular meeting in source data, but leveraging related chaos/HPA docs improves quality of discussion.\n- Only 1:1 participants: **Ossie** and **Wilford**—tight line of communication, so approvals should be quick.\n- Weekend falls between preparation and meeting date—plan front-loads major prep by **Jul 16** to avoid last-minute crunch.\n- If additional stakeholders need input (e.g., Keren or Terina for dashboard alignment), factor that in during Phase 1.\n\n---\n\n✅ **This plan allows for progressive prep (draft → finalize → confirm), keeps artifacts aligned with existing resilience and metrics context, and gives a 2–3 day gap before meeting for Wilford to review.**\n\n---\n\n👉 **Next step for you:**  \nDo you want me to **generate a one-line summary email with this plan to Wilford** (as a prep heads-up) *OR* create

Related context from June workshops on jitter/backoff (e.g., Gaussian jitter research, CI/CD changes) may be relevant.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠ Assumptions & Observations\n- Only the event subject and body mention HPA scaling and backoff.  \n- No direct HPA-specific files in grounding data, but **recent retry/jitter configuration work** from June deep dives is relevant (Gaussian jitter, canary work).  \n- You are the sole attendee aside from Ossie → expect tailored discussion; preparation burden is likely on both sides, but you should prepare artifacts and questions.  \n- No pre-attached deck found; may need to request materials or prepare your own visual/data extracts.  \n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Timeline (Meeting Date: **2025-07-19 at 15:00 UTC**)  \n*(All deadlines are in UTC unless otherwise noted)*  \n\n### **Phase 1: Immediate Prep (Today – July 14)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Review deep dive outputs (Gaussian jitter research, PR guard clauses, config tuning) for relevance to HPA scaling discussion | **July 14** | Wilford | Use files: `Gaussian_Jitter_Integration_Research_Paper.pdf`, `TransactionRouter_Config_Benchmark_Details.xlsx`, and action items in June workshops to identify retry/backoff strategies that impact scaling |\n| Draft list of desired outcomes for 1:1 | **July 14** | Wilford | Examples: confirm current HPA CPU/memory trigger configs, evaluate scaling lag vs retry storm mitigation, identify pipeline hooks for rollback during scale events |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Mid-Week Alignment (July 15 – July 17)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Request/confirm if Ossie has an agenda or pre-read deck | **July 15** | Wilford | If none exists, propose key agenda: 1) Review current HPA metrics 2) Retry/backoff impact on scaling 3) Draft action plan |\n| Gather metrics snapshot | **July 16** | Wilford | Pull latest Prometheus/Grafana charts for cluster: CPU usage, P95 latency under load, scaling event timestamps; highlight anomalies under prior chaos or canary experiments |\n| Outline talking points & mitigation options | **July 17** | Wilford | Include: metric thresholds, jitter factor tuning, circuit breaker/HPA interplay, risks from historical incidents |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Finalization (July 18)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Share pre-read summary with Ossie | **July 18 EOD** | Wilford | 1-page summary with charts + 3 decision points; email via Teams link |\n| Validate meeting logistics | **July 18** | Wilford | Confirm Teams link + time zone alignment with Ossie to avoid misfires |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Day-of Prep (July 19)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Quick tech check & resource readiness | **30 min before meeting** | Wilford | Ensure access to metrics dashboard + config repo for live reference |\n| Bring open JIRA/action items list | **Meeting start** | Wilford | Include any pending SEC-503, rollback guards, capacity governance tickets |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Key Dependencies\n- Access to Grafana dashboards & Prometheus queries (like those used during chaos drills & jitter config review).\n- Timely confirmation from Ossie on whether any structured deck exists.\n- Availability over weekend: Meeting is on **Saturday**—adjust time buffer for Friday finalization.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Risks & Mitigation\n- **Short runway (~7 days):** Lock agenda by **July 15** to avoid ad-hoc discussion.\n- **Historical context complexity:** Prepare a condensed cheat sheet; avoid deep dig during call.\n- **Weekend meeting:** Complete prep by July 18 in case of limited weekend support.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Next Action for You Today\n1. Block 1 hour tomorrow for **artifact review** (Gaussian jitter decks + benchmark spreadsheets).\n2. Draft **agenda proposal email to Ossie by July 15**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **create an email template to Ossie proposing a focused agenda and requesting pre-read materials**?  \nOr should I

Share outline with Wilford for alignment. |\n| Gather baseline HPA telemetry & retry logs | **July 10 (Thu)** | Wilford Taussig | Export CPU/memory utilization charts, pod scaling events, retry error logs for last 2 sprints. Required for data-driven discussion. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2 – Pre-read & Material Development**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Build HPA Metrics Summary & Scaling Scenarios | **July 12 (Sat)** | Ossie Ziller | Create concise deck: include current thresholds, scaling events vs latency, and retry backoff configuration. Reference chaos-related latency trends where relevant. |\n| Insert relevant Grafana snapshots (optional) | **July 13 (Sun)** | TBD (Ossie if Wilford cannot help) | Pull panel views (CPU burn rows show scaling impact) for visual context. |\n| Share Draft Deck for Review | **July 14 (Mon)** | Ossie Ziller | Email Wilford for input; allow 48 hrs feedback. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3 – Finalization**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Finalize Deck & Upload to Teams | **July 16 (Wed)** | Ossie Ziller | Confirm agenda locked and deck reflects feedback. Store in appropriate folder or meeting chat. |\n| Confirm Meeting Logistics & Link | **July 16 (Wed)** | Ossie Ziller | Verify Teams link works; send calendar reminder if needed. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4 – Pre-meeting Check**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Dry run / Talking Points prep | **July 18 (Fri)** | Ossie Ziller | Review talking points: HPA scaling triggers, retry effect, action plan post-meeting. |\n| Confirm Attendee Availability | **July 18 (Fri)** | Ossie Ziller | Ensure Wilford is still available and has reviewed pre-reads. |\n\n---\n\n## **Assumptions / Risks**\n- **No dependency on additional stakeholders** unless new requirements arise.\n- If Wilford delays data export past July 10, deck timeline compresses.\n- If link or Teams access changes, logistics check will mitigate a last-minute failure.\n\n---\n\n### 🔑 **Summary Timeline**\n- Jul 08: Agenda ready  \n- Jul 10: Data gathered  \n- Jul 12–14: Deck drafted & shared  \n- Jul 16: Final deck + logistics confirmed  \n- Jul 18: Dry run and confirmations  \n- Jul 19: Meeting @ 15:00 UTC  \n\n---\n\n✅ This plan is **practical** (13 days for content, 2-day buffer before meeting).\n\n---\n\n**Next Step for You (Ossie):**  \n- Kickstart **agenda draft by July 8** and immediately request Wilford to pull HPA scaling and retry data by July 10.  \n- Would you like me to **prepare a sample agenda framework and an early pre-read deck outline** as your next action item?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response

Given prior patterns:\n  - Expect **tech-heavy agenda** (metrics, scaling strategy)\n  - Likely need **performance graphs** and **config references** from prior TransactionRouter work (Helm/HPA possible ties)\n- Only two participants, but significant **depth** expected.  \n  → Plan should allow for context review and scenario validation.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Plan (HPA Scaling 1:1 Deep Dive)\n\n### **Meeting Day: July 19, 2025 (Saturday)**\n- **Deliverable:** Conduct 30-min deep dive on HPA metrics, retry backoff adjustments.\n- **Owner:** Wilford Taussig & Ossie Ziller\n- **Notes:** Ensure Teams link functional, HPA dashboard accessible, bring config references.\n\n---\n\n### **T–1 Day (July 18, 2025) — Finalization Phase**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Validate Teams Meeting Link & Calendar | Jul 18 | Wilford | Confirm access; test audio/video settings. |\n| Prepare Final Talking Points for Deep Dive | Jul 18 | Wilford | Summarize findings on HPA target metrics & retry strategy trade-offs. |\n| Share Read-Ahead Notes with Ossie (Optional) | Jul 18 | Wilford | Email/Teams message. Attach final one-pager if created. |\n\n---\n\n### **T–3 Days (July 16, 2025) — Review Phase**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Review Prior Config Tuning Outcomes | Jul 16 | Wilford | Check June deep-dive decks: *TransactionRouter_ConfigParameter_DeepDive.pptx*, *Gaussian_Jitter_Integration_Research_Paper.pdf*. Extract relevant retry backoff learnings for HPA context. |\n| Gather Latest HPA Metrics & Autoscaling History | Jul 16 | Wilford | Pull from monitoring dashboards (CPU/Mem autoscaler behaviors). Add to notebook/slide for review. |\n\n---\n\n### **T–5 Days (July 14, 2025) — Draft Phase**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft HPA & Backoff Analysis Summary | Jul 14 | Wilford | Outline: Current scaling thresholds, anomalies observed, retry backoff parameter proposes (min/max scaling events, jitter?). |\n| Validate Retry Backoff Config State | Jul 14 | Wilford | Cross-check config fragments or Helm values controlling jitterFactor, debounce timing, compare against June adjustments. |\n\n---\n\n### **T–10 Days (July 9, 2025) — Kickoff Prep**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm Meeting Scope & Agenda with Ossie | Jul 9 | Wilford | Teams chat: Verify if additional discussion points (e.g., canary rollout metrics) needed. |\n| Identify Required Data Sources | Jul 9 | Wilford | Ensure access to: Prometheus metrics, Grafana panels for CPU utilization, HPA status conditions. |\n\n---\n\n### **Assumptions & Risks**\n- *Assumption:* Meeting objectives limited to **HPA autoscaling behavior** and **retry strategy tuning** (not full platform deep dive).  \n- *Risk:* Lack of updated autoscaler metrics—mitigate by pulling data at least 3 days prior.\n- If Ossie adds new subtopics (e.g., traffic forecasts), revisit plan by T-10.\n\n---\n\n## 🚦 Quick Timeline Overview\n- **Jul 09:** Align scope with Ossie, confirm data sources  \n- **Jul 14:** Draft HPA summary & validate retry configs  \n- **Jul 16:** Pull latest performance/autoscaler metrics  \n- **Jul 18:** Finalize talking points & run AV check  \n- **Jul 19:** Conduct 1:1 deep dive  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Recommended Pre-Read Bundle for Reference:\n- **TransactionRouter_ConfigParameter_DeepDive.pptx** (EngineeringDocuments/Presentations)\n- **Gaussian_Jitter_Integration_Research_Paper.pdf** (EngineeringDocuments/Research)\n- **TransactionRouter_ConfigDeepDive_Metrics.xlsx** (for backoff performance comparison)\n\n---\n\n### Next Step for You:\nWould you like me to:  \n**A)** Build a consolidated **timeline chart (visual)** for this plan?  \n**B)** Draft a **Teams pre-read reminder message** to send Ossie on Jul 16?  \n**C)** Provide a **one-page briefing template** for HPA metrics and retry adjustments?  \n\n*(Reply A, B, C, or combo).*", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "",

Review P99 expressions for `migration_duration_seconds` and `rollback_duration_seconds` histograms  \n  2. Threshold color overrides for P99 (e.g., red >3s) and legend formatting  \n  3. Validate JSON model changes in `dashboard/migration_rollback.json` (lines 20–40)  \n  4. Plan timeline and reviewer assignment for EngineeringDocuments PR  \n- **Meeting Type:** Online (Teams)\n\n**Time available:** ≈16 hours from now → extremely tight; all prep must finish by midday UTC to allow breathing room before meeting.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Related Information\n- No direct file attachment for dashboard JSON, but related engineering file exists:  \n  `Optimization_Workshop_Planning_Document.docx` (covers performance tuning topics, so conceptual overlaps exist but not critical for this calibration meeting).\n- Since dashboard JSON is explicitly referenced, assume it’s in your code repository under `dashboard/migration_rollback.json`.\n\n---\n\n## 🗂 Key Assumptions\n- Meeting locked at 16:00 UTC today.  \n- No external dependencies except your and Era’s availability.  \n- Code updates and context are in Git repo; you and Era can access them.  \n- This is a tactical, short calibration sync, not a multi-day project.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Timeline (Starting from meeting time and working backward)\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Sync Before Meeting**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Finalize pre-read summary (key P99 formula changes, threshold note) and share on Teams chat | **14:30 UTC** (90 min before) | Shakia | Use agenda bullets + screenshot of current dashboard JSON segment; reduces meeting cold-start risk |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Validate and Stage Technical Content**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Pull latest `dashboard/migration_rollback.json` and verify panel JSON lines 20–40 (ensure expressions and color thresholds as per goal) | **13:30 UTC** | Era | Check variables for repeat support; confirm overrides for P99 lines |\n| Confirm threshold color mappings (e.g., P99 >3s = red) implemented correctly in JSON | **13:45 UTC** | Shakia | Cross-check with internal standard for high-latency visual alerts |\n| Draft pull request skeleton for EngineeringDocuments plan (you’ll finalize after meeting, but prep title/labels) | **14:00 UTC** | Shakia | Goal: reduce post-meeting turnaround |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Prep Collaborative Inputs**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Draft quick “Reviewer matrix” for dashboard JSON PR to discuss in meeting | **12:30 UTC** | Shakia | Identify who may review post-meeting—likely dashboard maintainers |\n| Ping Era in Teams to confirm readiness and share quick context note | **12:00 UTC** | Shakia | Include code link, ask if any blockers |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Early-Morning Kickoff / Set Workspace**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Open current Grafana dashboard and snapshot P99 graphs for reference in meeting | **11:30 UTC** | Era | Screenshots will support calibration discussion |\n| Reserve 30-min pre-meeting block in calendar for self-review & context alignment | **09:00 UTC** | Shakia | Just a personal prep slot |\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Risk & Mitigations\n- **Tight window** (16 hrs including sleeping hours): front-load prep early morning UTC; flag if Era is in different time zone.  \n- If JSON changes need repo access and network lag occurs, drop PR skeleton and instead queue for after meeting.  \n- No time for full dry run—focus on correct snapshot and expressions validation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nYou have a **compressed timeline—about 4–5 working hours once your day starts**. This plan prioritizes JSON validation → context sharing → pre-read summary → alignment on reviewers. Meeting should then flow with zero surprises.\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ Next Steps for You Right Now:\n1. Block 09:00–11:30 UTC for prep cycles.\n2. Ping Era in Teams early to confirm her morning availability.\n3. Pull JSON changes and schedule quick 30-min internal validation before noon UTC.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a Teams message template** to share with Era summarizing her pre-meeting tasks and the context link?

Workback must be aggressive.\n- Focus on ensuring participants are aligned on technical refactor details and have reviewed the code snippet before the session.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Plan (from Meeting Day Backward)\n\n### **Meeting Day: Tuesday, 2025-07-22**\n| Time (UTC) | Task | Owner | Notes |\n|-----------|------|--------|-------|\n| 13:50 | **Final Tech Check & Join** | All attendees | Verify Teams link access, ensure mic/cam working. |\n| 13:30 | **Upload Any Last-Minute Revisions to Shared Snippet** | Markita | Make sure Jenkins shared library snippet (`validateConfigFiles()`) latest version is available. |\n| 13:00 | **Confirm Action Items Table Prep in Confluence** | Markita / Danille | Ready template for capturing decisions live during meeting. |\n\n---\n\n### **Day Before: Monday, 2025-07-21 (Remaining Hours)**\n| Deadline (UTC) | Task | Owner | Notes |\n|---------------|------|--------|-------|\n| 23:00 | **Finalize Meeting Agenda** | Markita | Based on Event description: Extract schema validation/YAML lint steps, retentionDays config, doc updates. |\n| 22:00 | **Distribute Pre-Reading & Attachments** | Markita | Share `pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md` link and latest snippet PR link in Teams chat. |\n| 21:00 | **Review Pre-Read** | Danille | Ensure familiarity with validateConfigFiles() code, identify questions. |\n| 20:30 | **Verify Access & Permissions** | Danille | Confirm read/write access to repo and Confluence for documentation updates. |\n\n---\n\n## **Immediate Next Steps (Right Now before 20:00 UTC today)**\n- Markita posts Teams announcement with:\n  - Meeting agenda bullets.\n  - `pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md` link.\n  - Groovy snippet (or GitHub PR link).\n- Both attendees reserve at least 30–40 mins for **focused review** prior to meeting.\n\n---\n\n## **Dependencies & Risks**\n- **Dependency:** Final code snippet must be up to date; pre-read distributed tonight.\n- **Risk:** If pre-reading is delayed, meeting will turn into working session instead of decision session.\n- **Mitigation:** Push snippet and agenda immediately; encourage async comments in Teams prior to meeting.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Summary Timeline Snapshot\n- **T–18h:** Pre-reading distributed (Markita).\n- **T–17h:** Confirm repo & Confluence permissions (Danille).\n- **T–16h:** Both complete doc/code review.\n- **T–1h:** Upload any updates + prepare live notes template.\n- **Meeting Day:** 2025-07-22 14:00 UTC.\n\n---\n\n### Assumptions:\n- Meeting date/time from Event (July 22, 14:00 UTC) is correct.\n- No additional stakeholders beyond listed; if new required attendees emerge, escalate via Teams thread tonight.\n\n---\n\n👉 **Do you want me to generate a ready-to-send Teams message with agenda + pre-read links based on this plan?**

**Organizer:** Markita Sitra (you)  \n- **Required Attendees:** Markita Sitra, Danille Ciardullo  \n- **Location:** Virtual (online meeting)  \n- **Agenda & Objectives (from Event Body):**\n  - Discuss extraction of schema validation and YAML lint steps into reusable shared library function.\n  - Review `validateConfigFiles()` snippet and retentionDays options.\n  - Plan documentation updates in the **fraud-config** Confluence page.  \n- **Pre-read:** Review `pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md` (referenced in event body).\n\n---\n\n### **Current Context**\n- **Current time:** 2025-07-19T22:00:00+08:00 (~3.5 days before meeting)\n- Time is short → tasks must be front-loaded into the next 2–3 days.\n- Related materials:  \n  - Prior work on Jenkins shared library (`AnomalyRulesDeploy`, schema-validation gate) in **feature/fraud-config** branch (per **fraud_workshop_data.xlsx** and chats).  \n  - Docs referenced in meeting (Confluence ops/fraud/config).  \n- Dependencies: You and Danille have context from prior CI refactor work.\n\n---\n\n## **Workback Plan (Starting from Meeting Date: 2025-07-22)**\n\n| Phase | Task | Due Date (UTC) | Owner | Notes |\n|-------|------|---------------|-------|-------|\n| **Final Prep** | **Finalize deck and review doc links for meeting** | **2025-07-22 12:00** | Markita | Ensure `pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md` and related snippets accessible via Confluence; double-check permissions. |\n|  | Test screenshare & meeting platform | 2025-07-22 12:30 | Markita | Avoid last-minute technical issues. |\n| **Day Before** | Confirm attendee availability | 2025-07-21 16:00 | Markita | Quick chat ping to Danille confirming time and readiness. |\n|  | Send reminder email + agenda & key links | 2025-07-21 17:00 | Markita | Include meeting goals, pre-read doc path, and GitHub PR link if relevant. |\n| **Pre-read Completion** | **Review `pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md` (MANDATORY)** | 2025-07-21 12:00 | Danille, Markita | This is the core background for discussion per event notes. |\n| **Supporting Material Prep** | Extract current `validateConfigFiles()` snippet from shared library repo | 2025-07-20 18:00 | Danille | Link snippet with retentionDays options in Confluence. |\n|  | Summarize Jenkins shared library change history (schema-validation, lint insertion) | 2025-07-20 20:00 | Markita | Pull from feature/fraud-config commits and recent chat thread for context. |\n| **Early Groundwork** | Identify config files impacted (observability_config.yaml, security-policies.yml) | 2025-07-20 15:00 | Markita | Based on **fraud_workshop_data.xlsx** and `ops/fraud/config`. |\n|  | Draft Confluence note for “Shared Library Refactor Plan” | 2025-07-19 23:59 | Markita | Outline: objectives, code snippet section, retention options, link to PR #123 from fraud-config. |\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Timeline**\n- **Today (Jul 19):** Draft Confluence skeleton  \n- **Jul 20:** Collect snippets & summarize Jenkins changes  \n- **Jul 21:** Complete pre-read, send agenda/reminder  \n- **Jul 22:** Final deck, run tech check, host meeting  \n\n---\n\n## **Assumptions / Risks**\n- Meeting time confirmed as **Jul 22, 14:00 UTC** (from calendar event).\n- Pre-read doc exists in Confluence or repo; flagged for quick retrieval.\n- Only attendees: you + Danille; no need for larger sign-off pre-meeting.\n- If PR dependencies change (fraud-config branch merges), update snippet paths before session.\n- Aggressive timeline: weekend buffer is thin; prioritize early asset prep.\n\n---\n\n✅ Would you like me to **generate a ready-to-send planner email** with this timeline for Danille and include the

Review `validateConfigFiles()` snippet, retentionDays options, and plan documentation update on Confluence (`fraud-config`). Pre-read includes **pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md**.  \n- **Dependencies**: Past workshop artifacts include `Optimization_Workshop_InDepth_Presentation.pptx` and `HMAC_Validation_Layer_Integration_DetailedOverview.docx` (these show prior CI/CD shared library patterns—may inform discussion).  \n- **Risk Consideration**: Highly technical meeting, requires alignment on refactor plan; minimal time, so tasks must be sequenced tightly.  \n---\n\n## 📅 WORKBACK TIMELINE (Anchored to July 22, 2025 @ 14:00 UTC)\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Pre-Meeting Prep (Day Before & Morning Of)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Send final agenda and confirm dial-in link** | Jul 21 (EOD) | Markita | Include meeting goal, expected decisions, and attach final pre-read links |\n| **Test online meeting tech (screen share, code snippet view)** | Jul 21 | Markita | Validate Teams integration and Confluence screen sharing |\n| **Slack reminder to attendees with link to pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md** | Jul 21 | Markita | Ensure Danille has reviewed and highlighted any open questions |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Pre-Read Distribution & Review**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Upload `pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md` and `validateConfigFiles()` snippet to shared Confluence page** | Jul 18 | Markita | This is critical pre-read; confirm visibility permissions |\n| **Notify attendees with Confluence link and outline what to review** | Jul 18 | Markita | Include checklist: retentionDays impact, YAML lint step integration |\n| **Participants review and comment on pre-read** | Jul 18–19 | Danille & Markita | Add comments/questions in Confluence or via Teams thread |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Agenda & Structure Finalization**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Draft focused agenda in meeting invite (topics + timeboxes)** | Jul 17 | Markita | Sections: 1) Current schema-validation implementation, 2) Proposed shared library refactor steps, 3) Risks & rollback plan, 4) Action assignment |\n| **Incorporate key points from related artifacts (Optimization_Workshop docs)** | Jul 17 | Markita | Leverage lessons learned from Jenkins shared library update and validate compliance gating patterns |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Alignment on Goals & Inputs**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Review previous shared library lessons from Optimization_Workshop_Performance_Action_Tracker.xlsx and Jenkins gating patterns** | Jul 16 | Markita | Helps anticipate dependencies for schema + YAML lint enforcement |\n| **Confirm any known blockers or dependencies (e.g., Jenkins pipeline permissions)** | Jul 16 | Danille | Validate if additional SMEs are needed; escalate early |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Kickoff Prep**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Prepare meeting deck with goals, decision points, and proposed refactor flow** | Jul 20 | Markita | Use minimal slides: 1) Context, 2) Proposed changes—include code snippet and retentionDays config |\n| **Checklist for post-meeting deliverables (update fraud-config, update Jenkins shared library)** | Jul 20 | Markita | Pre-plan follow-up so actions can be captured during call |\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Key Dependencies\n- Pre-read (`pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md`) must be ready by Jul 18 for adequate review.\n- Markita owns most tasks; Danille provides input on retentionDays and YAML lint specifics.\n- Tight timeline → allow zero slippage; any delays cascade into reduced review time.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠 *Risk Mitigation & Buffer*\n- If pre-read cannot be completed by Jul 18, escalate in Slack and schedule an optional async review on Jul 19.\n- Validate Teams meeting link ASAP to avoid tech friction on meeting day.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Summary\nYou have **one week** until the meeting.

(Meeting already on calendar but confirm if any architect needs to join.) |\n| Upload current `validateConfigFiles()` snippet & pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md to shared folder | **2025-07-10** | Markita | Ensures attendees review the latest snippet; link in invite or Confluence. |\n| Draft & circulate preliminary agenda with key discussion points | **2025-07-10** | Markita | Include objectives: schema validation refactor, YAML lint integration, retentionDays confirmation. |\n| **PHASE 2: Deep Dive & Analysis** ||||\n| Pull historical compliance pipeline patterns from **Optimization Workshop** docs (e.g., CI Gate Enforcement in `Optimization_Workshop_InDepth_Presentation.pptx` and `Integration_Test_Suite_CI_Enforcement_Detailed.docx`) | **2025-07-11** | Danille | Use relevant sections on shared library enforcement for lint/security checks as references. |\n| Identify current schema validation steps and YAML lint tools used in DevOps pipelines | **2025-07-12** | Danille | Cross-check Jenkins shared library and CI jobs. |\n| Review retentionDays logic + confirm options with stakeholders | **2025-07-14** | Markita | May require brief Slack/Teams poll; dependency for final refactor design. |\n| **PHASE 3: Prototype & Feedback** ||||\n| Prepare prototype shared library function integrating schema validation + YAML lint | **2025-07-16** | Danille (with input from Markita) | Build on existing pipeline snippet; reference validateConfigFiles() in prior design. |\n| Circulate draft refactor design + example Jenkinsfile snippet in Confluence | **2025-07-17** | Markita | Tag attendees for async feedback. |\n| Collect feedback and finalize technical decisions (e.g., retentionDays default, schema lint severity levels) | **2025-07-18** | Both | Buffer for discussion threads via chat or email. |\n| **PHASE 4: Finalization & Pre-Read Distribution** ||||\n| Publish finalized shared library proposal and update **fraud-config Confluence** page | **2025-07-19** | Markita | Include link to pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md and example Jenkins snippet. |\n| Share pre-read materials with attendees through meeting invite update | **2025-07-19** | Markita | Attach key Confluence links and confirm those have access. |\n| (Optional) Quick dry run in non-prod Jenkins job for confidence | **2025-07-20** | Danille | Use staging environment if feasible; note outcome in docs. |\n| Send reminder note + outline key decision points | **2025-07-21** | Markita | Reinforce time-boxed agenda. |\n| **MEETING: Shared Library Refactor for Schema Validation** | **2025-07-22 @ 14:00 UTC** | All | Virtual session; decision gate for library rollout. |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Additional Recommendations & Dependencies:\n- **Risk:** Pre-read quality and code snippet accuracy are critical. Missing this may derail the session.  \n- **Leverage References:** Use prior docs like *Integration_Test_Suite_CI_Enforcement_Detailed.docx* for SonarQube, swagger-lint integration—similar patterns apply here.  \n- **Tools/Links Needed:** Confluence fraud-config page, shared Jenkins repo, prior PR examples (#679 format).  \n- **Buffer:** Keep July 21 open for urgent edits or follow-ups from attendees.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Assumptions**\n- Meeting scope is strictly pipeline shared library refactor; external topics (e.g., HMAC or cluster scaling) excluded.  \n- `pipeline-shared-library-refactor.md` exists and is accessible in Confluence or internal repo.  \n- No additional stakeholders beyond Markita and Danille unless flagged in next confirmation.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n✅ Export this as a **visual Gantt-style timeline** in Excel (with auto-formulas and days-to-meeting)?  \n✅ Generate an **email draft to attendees with agenda & pre-read links** (aligned to this plan)?  \nOr both?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should include a backward timeline from T₀ with dependency-aware sequencing", "level": "critical", "dimension": "S2", "dimension_name": "Timeline Alignment", "layer": "structural", "weight": 3, "sourceID": "31f8e5f8-91b4-4f82-bb5c-cf60e8c78699", "original_text": "The response should state the meeting date and time as July 22, 2025 at 14:00 UTC, aligned with the actual event schedule....", "rationale": {"mapping_reason": "Original assertion focuses on timeline and alignment with event schedule, which corresponds to S2 (Timeline Alignment).", "conversion_changes": ["Removed specific date/time (July 22, 2025 at 14:00 UTC)", "Generalized to backward timeline requirement per template"], "template_alignment": "Used S2 template: 'The response should include a backward timeline from T₀ with dependency-aware sequencing'", "value_removed": "Specific meeting date/time details"}, "quality_assessment": {"is_well_formed": true, "is_testable": true, "issues": []}, "conversion_method": "gpt5"}, {"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should assign an owner for each [TASK] or specify role/skill placeholder", "level": "critical", "dimension": "S3", "dimension_name": "Ownership Assignment", "layer": "structural", "weight": 3, "sourceID": "31f8e5f8-91b4-4f82-bb5c-cf60e8c78699", "original_text": "The response should list both required attendees Markita Sitra and Danille Ciardullo as per the meeting invite....", "rationale": {"mapping_reason": "Original assertion relates to ensuring attendees are listed, which ties to ownership clarity.

Review test plan coverage across JSON schema versions v1 and v2  \n  2. Error output format (line numbers, schema paths, console summary tables)  \n  3. Prometheus counter labels for schema validation  \n  4. Jenkinsfile.validate integration steps and dry-run results  \n  5. Sync Confluence documentation with sample failure messages  \n- **Preparation Materials Referenced:**\n    - *PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md* (Wilford draft)\n    - Dry-run logs  \n    - Relevant shared library code changes (validatePipelineSchema)\n    - Confluence page for pipeline interface examples  \n\n**Current Time:** 2025-07-18T22:00:00+08:00 (UTC+8)  \n→ That’s **14:00 UTC on July 18**, so there are **about 16 hours until the meeting** (in UTC).  \n**Note:** The window is extremely tight – plan is aggressive and assumes immediate action.\n\n---\n\n## **Workback Plan**\n\n### **Meeting Day: July 19, 2025**\n**14:00 UTC — One-on-One Meeting Begins**  \nObjective: Complete deep technical review and agree on next integration steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Final Pre-Meeting Prep (Last 4–6 hrs before meeting)**\n| Task | Due Date (UTC) | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------------|-------|-------|\n| Upload final version of *PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md* | **2025-07-19 10:00** | Wilford | Must include coverage matrix: schema versions, negative scenarios, Prometheus metrics coverage |\n| Validate Jenkinsfile.validate snippet with current shared library build | **2025-07-19 11:00** | Shakia | Confirm dry-run stage passes and outputs Prometheus labels correctly |\n| Share meeting prep email with Teams link + attached Confluence page link | **2025-07-19 12:00** | Shakia | Include quick agenda bullets and reference docs |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Early Morning Coordination (6–10 hrs before meeting)**\n| Task | Due Date (UTC) | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------------|-------|-------|\n| Publish sample validation failure outputs in Confluence | **2025-07-19 07:00** | Wilford | Add line-number mapping and schema path examples |\n| Push dry-run log artifacts to shared drive | **2025-07-19 07:30** | Wilford | Verify that logs highlight missing `agent` declarations as seen yesterday |\n| Cross-check Prometheus counter label schema (`status`, `schema_version`, `violation_count`) | **2025-07-19 08:30** | Shakia | Confirm Prometheus scrape configs are aligned with alerting strategy from Secure Sprint |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Night of July 18 → Before sleeping)**  \n| Task | Due Date (UTC) | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------------|-------|-------|\n| Review and annotate *PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md* draft | **2025-07-18 21:30** | Shakia | Add edge cases: missing `steps`, malformed `environment` entries |\n| Validate Confluence section 2.3 snippets | **2025-07-18 22:00** | Wilford | Ensure `validatePipelineSchema` invocation matches last patch |\n| Prepare quick comparison table of JSON schema v1 vs v2 breaking changes | **2025-07-19 00:00** | Shakia | Needed for agenda item 1 |\n| Confirm Teams link and calendar availability | **2025-07-19 00:30** | Shakia | No conflicts reported in schedule |\n\n---\n\n## **Assumptions**\n- **Meeting date/time confirmed** from grounding data: *2025-07-19T14:00 UTC*.\n- No additional stakeholders expected; user is primary organizer.\n- All artifacts mentioned exist locally or in shared repositories (Confluence/GitHub).\n- Timeline is aggressive; if slip occurs, prioritize:  \n  1. Test plan finalization  \n  2. Dry-run validation summary  \n  3. Prometheus metric alignment  \n\n## **Key Risks & Mitigation**\n- **Risk:** Limited turnaround for edits on Confluence/test plan  \n  *Mitigation:* Parallelize artifact updates; communicate hard cutoff times in group chat.\n- **Risk:** Missing dry-run logs at meeting time  \n  *Mitigation:* Push partial logs early, append incremental changes.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Quick Summary**\n- You have **~16 hrs total**, so prep MUST start now.\n- Today (UTC evening): finalize test plan draft and schema comparison.\n- Morning UTC: upload examples and Prometheus validation.\n- By 12:00 UTC: send prep email and finalize Jenkins snippet dry run.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **also create a condensed checklist version for quick tracking in Teams or email**, or should I **build an integrated timeline in Outlook/Planner with reminders for each milestone**?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should state the meeting [SUBJECT],

Test scenarios coverage across JSON schema versions v1 and v2  \n  2. Error output format: line numbers, schema paths, and console summary tables  \n  3. Prometheus counter labels: status, schema_version, violation_count  \n  4. Jenkinsfile.validate integration steps and dry-run results  \n  5. Confluence page sync: sample failure messages and docs update  \n- **Pre-read requirements:** *PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md draft* and *recent dry-run logs*  \n\n**Current time:** July 16, 2025, 22:00 (+08:00)  \n**Time to meeting:** ~2.5 days (very tight timeline).\n\n---\n\n## 🔒 Assumptions & Constraints\n- Meeting date is confirmed from Event metadata (July 19).\n- No weekend blocking mentioned → assume tasks must be scheduled aggressively in next ~60 hours.\n- Owners are inferred based on roles:  \n  - **You (Shakia):** Organizer & primary reviewer  \n  - **Wilford:** Draft plan author, dry-run executor  \n  - Docs/Confluence update assumed under Shakia unless delegated.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Timeline (from Meeting Day → Backward)\n\n---\n\n### **Day 0 – July 19 (Meeting Day)**  \n**14:00 UTC:** **Conduct the Deep Dive**  \n- Validate test plan completeness  \n- Walk through Prometheus metrics & Jenkinsfile integration  \n- Capture final notes & action items.\n\n---\n\n### **Day -1 to Day 0 (July 18 by EOD UTC)**  \n**Task:** Finalize Agenda Lock & Share Meeting Link (if not done)  \n- **Owner:** Shakia  \n- **Notes:** Confirm Teams link works. Provide last-minute instructions in chat/email.\n\n**Task:** Upload Final Pre-Read Packet (PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md + Dry-Run Logs)  \n- **Owner:** Wilford  \n- **Dependencies:** Dry-run script executed and logs verified on July 18 AM.  \n- **Notes:** Store in Shared Docs or attach to meeting invite.\n\n---\n\n### **Day -1 (July 18, AM UTC)**  \n**Task:** Complete Jenkinsfile.validate Dry Run & Capture Logs  \n- **Owner:** Wilford  \n- **Dependencies:** Validate schema v1 and v2 scenarios pass.  \n- **Risk:** Last window for fixing failures is <24 hrs; escalate if blockers found.  \n- **Output:** Clean run logs for discussion.\n\n---\n\n### **Day -2 (July 17 PM UTC)**  \n**Task:** Review Test Scenarios Draft in PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md  \n- **Owner:** Shakia  \n- **Dependencies:** Wilford to post initial MD draft earlier July 17.  \n- **Notes:** Ensure JSON schema coverage and error messaging align with agenda.\n\n**Task:** Annotate Prometheus Metric Label Plan  \n- **Owner:** Wilford  \n- **Notes:** Document label keys and sample counter format in MD draft.\n\n---\n\n### **Day -2 (July 17 AM UTC)**  \n**Task:** Post Initial Draft of PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md  \n- **Owner:** Wilford  \n- **Content:** Include: schema coverage matrix, failure output tables, Prometheus integration approach.  \n- **Notes:** Share via Teams or upload to engineering doc space.\n\n---\n\n## ✔️ Summary Table\n\n| Task | Due Date (UTC) | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------------|-------|-------|\n| Draft PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md | Jul 17 AM | Wilford | Include test matrix + sample error format |\n| Review Draft & Add Feedback | Jul 17 PM | Shakia | Focus on schema coverage & metrics |\n| Dry Run Jenkinsfile.validate & Collect Logs | Jul 18 AM | Wilford | Final success for v1 & v2 |\n| Finalize Pre-Read Packet & Upload | Jul 18 EOD | Wilford | MD doc + logs bundled |\n| Confirm Agenda & Tech Setup | Jul 18 EOD | Shakia | Ensure Teams link and doc access |\n| Conduct Deep Dive | Jul 19, 14:00 | Both | Execute agenda and log action items |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Risks & Mitigations\n- **Risk:** Dry run fails late  \n  → **Mitigation:** Block time on July 18 midday to troubleshoot together.\n- **Risk:** Missing pre-read materials  \n  → **Mitigation:** Use Teams chat to confirm readiness by Jul 18 EOD UTC.\n\n---\n\n#### Would you like me to:\n✔ **Generate a ready-to-share visual timeline (Gantt chart)** for this in **PowerPoint or Excel**?  \n✔ Or **draft a structured Teams message/email** to send Wilford summarizing these deadlines?  \n\n*(Both options can be prepared in a few minutes.)*", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should state the

Test scenarios coverage across JSON schema versions v1 and v2  \n  2. Error output format: line numbers, schema paths, console summary tables  \n  3. **Prometheus counter labels:** status, schema_version, violation_count  \n  4. Jenkinsfile.validate integration steps and dry-run results  \n  5. Confluence page sync: sample failure messages & docs updates  \n- **Pre-Meeting Artifacts Requested:**  \n  - `PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md` draft  \n  - Recent dry-run logs for validation tests  \n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Time Horizon & Constraints\n- Only ~2.5 days remain before meeting.  \n- Working days available: **July 17, July 18**, and early July 19 (as a buffer).  \n- Tight timeline → Tasks must be sequenced efficiently and dependencies acknowledged.  \n\n---\n\n# 📅 WORKBACK PLAN\n\n### **Meeting Day**\n**July 19, 2025 (14:00 UTC)**  \n- **Meeting Execution:** Join Teams link from calendar event.  \n- Ensure all required files (test plan, dry-run logs, Confluence updates) are organized and easily shareable.\n\n---\n\n### **Finalization Phase**\n**July 18 (End of Day UTC)**  \n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Finalize PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md | Jul 18 EOD | Wilford | Ensure coverage across schema v1/v2, include error format and Prometheus counter labels. |\n| Validate dry-run logs & summarize results | Jul 18 EOD | Wilford | Logs should show execution of `Jenkinsfile.validate`; highlight validation failures and console formats discussed in agenda. |\n| Confirm Teams meeting link and time | Jul 18 | Wilford | Double-check conversion between UTC and your local time (UTC+8: meeting is **Jul 19, 22:00 local**). |\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation Phase**\n**July 17**  \n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Draft PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md | Jul 17 | Wilford | Outline agenda topics: scenarios for v1/v2 schemas, output format, metrics. |\n| Collect last dry-run logs from Jenkins shared library | Jul 17 | Wilford | Make sure logs are complete; if stale, trigger a new dry run on `validatePipelineSchema`. |\n| Identify gaps against agenda (e.g., missing Prometheus counter labels) | Jul 17 | Wilford | Note open questions for Shakia if any unclear. |\n\n---\n\n### **Buffer & Risk Mitigation**\n- **Morning July 19:** Quick check that docs & logs are uploaded where accessible (Confluence or shared folder).  \n- Consider sending a **pre-read email to Shakia** by Jul 18 evening UTC with attached draft and key findings:  \n  _Subject: Pre-read for Jenkins Shared Library Test Plan Deep Dive — Jul 19_  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Assumptions & Open Points\n- Meeting date is confirmed from grounding data: Jul 19, 14:00 UTC.  \n- Owner for all tasks is **Wilford Taussig** (you), since it’s a 1:1 session and no other prep owners mentioned.  \n- No extra participants or presentation deck requested; it's working-level interaction.  \n- If PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md doesn’t exist yet, start from scratch using meeting agenda as structure.  \n\n---\n\n# 🔍 Summary Timeline\n- **Jul 17:** Draft test plan, fetch logs, identify gaps  \n- **Jul 18:** Finalize docs & logs, email pre-read, verify meeting logistics  \n- **Jul 19:** Quick check, attend meeting fully prepared  \n\n---\n\n✅ Would you like me to **(a)** generate a **structured Markdown task board with hyperlinks** for tracking in Teams/Planner, or **(b)** draft an **email template to Shakia with the

needed** | **July 13** | Shakia | Meeting is already on Wilford’s calendar; confirm no conflicts. |\n| **Ensure latest draft of `PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md` exists in repo or shared location** | **July 14** | Wilford | Needed for review and discussion during the deep dive. |\n| **Collect latest dry-run Jenkinsfile.validate logs** | **July 14** | Wilford | Ensure coverage metrics and any error formatting examples are included. |\n\n---\n\n## **Phase 2: Agenda Alignment & Pre-Read Distribution**\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Draft concise

from Outlook event.\n- Owners inferred from roles:  \n  - **Wilford**: test logs and validation tasks → He's DevOps Engineer handling pipelines.  \n  - **Shakia (you)**: agenda, logistics, coordination.\n- No additional stakeholders indicated; remains an internal 1:1.\n- If Jenkins shared library or Prometheus metrics PRs exist, bring references but not required for pre-reads.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Summary of Critical Deadlines\n- **July 14:** Draft test plan + dry-run logs available.  \n- **July 15:** All pre-reads distributed & agenda reconfirmed.  \n- **July 18:**

Review test scenarios coverage across JSON schema versions (v1 & v2)\n  2. Error output format (line numbers, schema paths, console summary tables)\n  3. Prometheus counters for validation failures (`status`, `schema_version`, `violation_count`)\n  4. Jenkinsfile.validate integration steps and dry-run results\n  5. Confluence page sync: sample failure messages\n- **Required Preconditions/Inputs:**\n  - *PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md* draft  \n  - Recent dry-run logs  \n- **Related Work (from chats, files & emails):**\n  - Jenkins shared library work tracked under prior actions (integration stages, Prometheus metrics)\n  - Observability improvements and error handling from migration rollback projects  \n  - Likely relevant files: MigrationRollbackAutomationResearch.pdf, Jenkins pipeline coverage.groovy, Canary guard clause references (but not attached to this invite)\n- **Dependencies:** Need dry-run data available and documentation drafted before the meeting.\n\n---\n\n## 🗓 Workback Timeline (Starting from 2025-07-19, working backward)\n\n| **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes/Dependencies** |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| **Meeting Day:** Conduct 1:1 deep dive session | **Jul 19 (Sat), 14:00 UTC** | Shakia & Wilford | Ensure Teams link ready; validate screen share setup |\n| **Final Agenda & Material Check (Lock)** | **Jul 18 (Fri), EOD UTC** | Shakia | Verify TestPlan.md and dry-run logs uploaded and accessible; confirm Teams link |\n| **Complete Jenkins Dry-Run for validatePipelineSchema** | **Jul 17 (Thu)** | Wilford | Must use latest Jenkinsfile.validate stage; capture logs and metrics snapshot (Prometheus counters) |\n| **Update TestPlan.md with dry-run results** | **Jul 16 (Wed)** | Shakia | Include screenshots of failure message structure (line numbers, schema paths); incorporate metric labels |\n| **Align on Metrics & Alert Labels** | **Jul 15 (Tue)** | Wilford | Validate Prometheus counters (`status`, `schema_version`, `violation_count`) exist and scrape correctly |\n| **Draft Confluence Page & Placeholders for Samples** | **Jul 14 (Mon)** | Shakia | Create page with agenda sections + placeholders for sample messages |\n| **Review Jenkins Integration Steps** *(verify error output format + schema versions)* | **Jul 11 (Fri)** | Both | Cross-check Jenkins pipeline block vs prior shared library updates; ensure migration rollback guard logic not broken |\n| **Initial Draft of PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md** | **Jul 10 (Thu)** | Shakia | Cover: schema v1/v2 cases, error reporting, metrics hooks |\n| **Confirm Access to Jenkins Env & Logs** | **Jul 08 (Tue)** | Wilford | Validate credentials for pipeline dry-run; ensure Prometheus dashboard reachable |\n| **Prep Kickoff Check-in Email (Objectives + Material Links)** | **Jul 07 (Mon)** | Shakia | Summarize goals, link to draft TestPlan.md, Confluence skeleton |\n\n---\n\n### **Assumptions & Risks**\n- **Meeting timing is fixed** (Jul 19 per calendar event). If time shifts, adjust due dates.\n- Only one attendee (Wilford), so communication is direct — minimal scheduling overhead.\n- Relevant docs like *PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md* likely stored in internal repo (not provided in data) — owner must verify path.\n- Jenkins environment and Prometheus metrics integration assumed already partially implemented (from earlier migration rollback enhancements).\n- No holiday conflicts detected in this 2-week window.  \n- Risk: Delayed dry-run execution could compress final review and documentation window. *Mitigation:* Start dry-run at least 48 hrs before finalization (Jul 17).\n\n---\n\n## **Plan Summary by Phase**\n**Phase 1: Foundation (Jul 07–10)**  \n- Kickoff email  \n- Draft TestPlan.md  \n- Access confirmation for Jenkins & dashboards  \n\n**Phase 2: Mid-Prep (Jul 11–15)**  \n- Review Jenkins integration logic  \n- Metrics validation (Prometheus labels)  \n- Initial Confluence structure  \n\n**Phase 3: Finalization (Jul 16–18)**  \n- Insert dry-run results into TestPlan.md  \n- Lock final materials  \n- Double-check Teams meeting link  \n\n---\n\n✅ This plan provides:\n\n- **Clear deadlines** aligned to actual remaining days (14 days buffer used strategically).\n- **Dependencies mapped** (dry-run → documentation → review).\n- **Named owners** based on roles and context.\n- **Actionable steps** tied to artifacts mentioned in grounding data.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to**:\n✔ Generate this as an interactive **Microsoft Planner** or **Excel template** for tracking?  \n✔ Draft the **kickoff email

me make a workback plan for the upcoming meeting 'One-on-One: Grafana Dashboard & Alert Tuning Deep Dive'", "response": "Here’s an actionable **workback plan** for your upcoming meeting, based strictly on the provided data:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Anchored Meeting Details   \n**Meeting:** *One-on-One: Grafana Dashboard & Alert Tuning Deep Dive*  \n**Date & Time:** **2025-07-24**, 16:00–16:30 UTC (Teams link provided)  \n**Organizer:** Shari Jatho  \n**Attendees:** Shari Jatho, Emory Scherping  \n**Agenda (from event body):**  \n- Review current panel JSON and threshold color mappings (`jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`)  \n- Discuss legend formatting and grouping by `cache_size` labels  \n- Iterate on **PromQL alert expressions** for `jwt_cache_thrash` and `ci_cache_resize_invocations` metrics  \n- Plan demo screens and walkthrough for Monday’s stand-up  \n- Identify missing metrics or panel adjustments  \n\n**Related Context:**  \n- Current time: **2025-07-24T00:00:00+08:00** (~08:00 UTC) → ~8 hours until meeting.  \n- Recent chats/emails confirm you’ve been working on Grafana dashboards, PromQL alert tuning, and related control mappings.  \n- Panel JSON and dashboard config mentioned (`jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`).  \n- Current tasks involve aligning compliance SLAs and Grafana alert panels (per chats with Emory).  \n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Constraints & Assumptions  \n- **Very tight timeline:** ~8 hours remain, so tasks must be prioritized and streamlined.  \n- **Owners:** Based on roles – Shari (Solutions Architect) owns meeting content/logistics; Emory (DevOps) provides technical validations.  \n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Plan: Backward from 2025-07-24 16:00 UTC  \n\n### **T – 0h (Meeting Start): 16:00 UTC**\n- **Goal:** Fully prepared for sync with up-to-date dashboards, threshold logic, and demo assets.\n\n---\n\n### **T – 1h: 15:00 UTC | Final Pre-Check & Dry Run**  \n- **Task:**  \n  - Validate PromQL alert expressions in staging for `jwt_cache_thrash` and `ci_cache_resize_invocations`.  \n  - Confirm dashboard panels render correctly in Grafana with updated JSON.  \n  - Screen-share dry run (Emory + Shari): run through agenda items to ensure flow in 10 min.  \n- **Owner:** Emory & Shari  \n- **Notes:** Dependencies → Panel updates & queries must be complete by this point.  \n\n---\n\n### **T – 3h: 13:00 UTC | Content Finalization & Panels Export**  \n- **Task:**  \n  - Export current Grafana dashboard JSON as backup (`jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`).  \n  - Capture 2–3 **demo screenshots** for stand-up preview.  \n  - Insert highlights into Confluence/Teams notes for quick-share during call.  \n- **Owner:** Shari  \n- **Notes:** Focus on thresholds and compliance metrics grouping.  \n\n---\n\n### **T – 5h: 11:00 UTC | PromQL & Dashboard Updates (Core Prep)**  \n- **Task:**  \n  - Align alert rules based on prior discussion.  \n  - Update JSON for color mapping and legend formatting.  \n- **Owner:** Emory (queries), Shari (visual alignment).  \n- **Notes:** Use prior snippet guidance from Observability chat.  \n\n---\n\n### **T – 6.5h: 09:30 UTC | Confirm Dependencies & Pre-Reads**  \n- **Task:**  \n  - Locate `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json` panel file in repo/Teams.  \n  - Confirm Emory has Prometheus + staging data access.  \n  - Notify Emory of meeting priorities.  \n- **Owner:** Shari  \n- **Notes:** If file not found, pull JSON from Grafana API export.  \n\n---\n\n### **Morning Buffer (Now → 09:30 UTC)**  \n- Skim pending comments in #monitoring-observability chat.  \n- Draft 1-slide cheat sheet summarizing key metrics and SLA thresholds. \n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Critical Path & Risks  \n- **Risk:** Limited time for major schema changes—focus on alert accuracy & panel clarity.  \n- **Mitigation:** Treat Monday stand-up demo as Phase 2 for advanced refinements.  \n- **Assumption:** Current JSON + queries are 90% complete.

Review current panel JSON and threshold color mappings (File: *jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json*).\n  2. Discuss legend formatting and grouping by `cache_size` labels.\n  3. Iterate on PromQL alert expressions for `jwt_cache_thrash` and `ci_cache_resize_invocations`.\n  4. Plan demo screens & walkthrough for Monday’s stand-up.\n  5. Identify missing metrics or panel adjustments.\n\n**Current Time:** July 24, 2025, 00:00 UTC+8 → effectively ~**16 hours before meeting start**.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠ Tight Timeline Note\nWith only **16 hours** until the meeting and most collaborators likely in US time zones, tasks must be executed in a compressed window or asynchronously overnight.\n\n---\n\n## **Workback Plan Timeline**\n\n### **Meeting Day (July 24, 2025)**  \n**16:00 UTC → Meeting Start**  \nGoal: Walk in with final panel preview and updated PromQL queries validated.\n\n---\n\n### **T–4h (12:00 UTC): Final Verification**\n- **Task:** Validate updated Grafana dashboard JSON in staging.\n- **Owner:** Emory Scherping  \n- **Dependencies:** JSON edits from earlier task pushed to config repo.\n- **Notes:**  \n  - Ensure `cache_size` grouping works in legend.  \n  - Check color mappings against thresholds agreed in chat (`>2 thrash warnings threshold for 5m`).  \n\n---\n\n### **T–6h (10:00 UTC): Push Dashboard JSON & Share Preview Link**\n- **Task:** Merge Grafana dashboard JSON updates into engineering dashboards folder.\n- **Owner:** Emory Scherping  \n- **Dependencies:** Local edits finalized by ~08:00 UTC.\n- **Notes:**  \n  - Tag Shari on PR.  \n  - Post updated dashboard screenshot to Teams chat and link to Grafana (`/d/lkj345 or similar`).  \n\n---\n\n### **T–8h (08:00 UTC): Finalize JSON Edits & PromQL Queries**\n- **Task:** Complete edits in *jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json*.\n- **Owner:** Emory Scherping  \n- **Content to confirm:**  \n  - Heatmap thresholds (`0 / 2 / 5`), legend formatting to show both count and % of thrash warnings.  \n  - Panels for:\n    - `jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total` (with cache_size label group)\n    - `ci_cache_resize_invocations_total` (add “by cache_size” breakdown)\n  - Apply previous chat recommendations:\n    - Add region label to PromQL:  \n      `sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job=\"checkout-service\",flag=~\"checkout_sql_batch_enabled|hibernate_query_cache_enabled\"}[5m])) by (le,flag,region)`  \n\n---\n\n### **T–14h (Roll into Today Morning in US Time): Draft Update & Ping Shari**\n- **Task:** Send quick status in Teams:\n  - Confirm meeting agenda alignment.\n  - Share planned JSON diffs and PromQL queries for approval.\n- **Owner:** Emory Scherping  \n- **Why:** Gives organizer early visibility and avoids surprises.  \n\n---\n\n## **Completed Before or Carried Over If Already in Progress**\n- Prometheus alert thresholds finalized in chat (July 23).\n- Background analysis from *jwt-cache-optimization-metrics* channel already provides context — leverage directly.\n\n---\n\n## **Artifacts & References**\n- **Dashboard JSON File:** `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`\n- **PromQL Samples:**  \n  - Thrash warnings:  \n    `sum by (cache_size)(increase(jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total[5m])) > 2`  \n  - Resize invocations:  \n    `increase(ci_cache_resize_invocations_total[5m]) by (cache_size)`\n- **Design Inputs:** Grafana panel options mentioned in chat (color thresholds, legend grouping).\n---\n\n### **Key Risks & Mitigations**\n- **Risk:** Compressed timeline for JSON edits → Low buffer for validation.\n  - **Mitigation:** Use existing staging dashboard for smoke tests; revert quickly if Grafana import fails.\n- **Risk:** Prometheus scrape lag may affect real-time check.\n  - **Mitigation:** Run dry-run query in Prometheus UI before meeting.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Summary Table**\n\n| Phase              | Task                                                   | Owner           | Due (UTC) | Notes |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------|-------|\n| Meeting            | Deep dive & live preview                             | Both           | 16:00     | Teams call |\n| T–4h               | Validate Grafana dashboard & PromQL alerts           | Emory          | 12:00     | Ensure cache_size grouping works |\n| T–6h               | Merge JSON edits & share Grafana link                | Emory          | 10:00     | Post in Teams |\n| T–8h               | Finalize JSON edits & confirm PromQL in staging      | Emory          | 08:00     | Use previous chat thresholds |\n| T–14h              | Ping Shari with planned changes summary              | Emory          | 02:00     | Include screenshot or diff |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Next Action for You (immediate):\n- **Start JSON cleanup & PromQL query updates NOW** (complete by ~08:00 UTC).\n- Prepare 2–3 screenshot panels before 12:00 UTC for final validation.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-send Teams update for Shari summarizing your plan and linking relevant files**?

Meeting Details (Extracted from Grounding Data)\n- **Meeting Title:** One-on-One: Grafana Dashboard & Alert Tuning Deep Dive  \n- **Scheduled Date & Time:** **2025-07-24, 16:00–16:30 UTC**  \n- **Location:** Microsoft Teams (link: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/dashboard-tuning`)  \n- **Organizer:** Shari Jatho (Solutions Architect)  \n- **Required Attendees:**  \n  - Shari Jatho (`lod_sharij`)  \n  - Emory Scherping (`lod_emorys`) *(you are an attendee)*  \n- **Agenda (from event body):**  \n  1. Review current Grafana panel JSON and threshold color mappings (file: `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`).  \n  2. Discuss legend formatting and cache_size grouping.  \n  3. Iterate on PromQL alert expressions for thrash warnings and resize invocations.  \n  4. Plan demo screens & walkthrough for Monday’s stand-up.  \n  5. Identify missing metrics/panel adjustments.  \n- **Attachments:** *(None provided explicitly; but reference file mentioned in agenda: `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`.)*  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ 2. Time Window & Constraints\n- **Current Time:** 2025-07-22T00:00:00+08:00 → effectively **July 21, 16:00 UTC**.  \n- **Time to Meeting:** ~**3 days**.  \n- **Priority:** High → compressed timeline, tasks must be clearly staged with short turnarounds.  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ 3. Preparation Milestones (Based on Agenda & Dependencies)\n\nBelow is the **Workback Plan**, starting from meeting day and working backward:\n\n#### **Phase 1: Final Confirmation (Day of Meeting)**\n| # | Task | Due Date (UTC) | Owner | Notes |\n|---|------|----------------|-------|-------|\n| 1 | Join One-on-One Meeting | 2025-07-24 16:00 | Emory | Teams link provided in invite. |\n| 2 | Have updated Grafana dashboard JSON & PromQL alerts ready to share | 2025-07-24 14:00 | Emory/Shari | Any edits must be finalized. |\n\n#### **Phase 2: Dry Run & Material Lock (T‑1 Day)**\n| # | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|---|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 3 | Perform quick **walkthrough of dashboard changes + alert simulations** | 2025-07-23 16:00 | Emory | Confirm no color mapping misalignments; validate alert firing using sample Prometheus range. |\n| 4 | Send **updated panel JSON and PromQL snippets** to Shari via Teams chat | 2025-07-23 14:00 | Emory | Include legend grouping updates and threshold mapping changes. |\n| 5 | Validate **Teams link and meeting time** | 2025-07-23 13:00 | Emory | Cross-check calendar invite and ensure no conflicts. |\n\n#### **Phase 3: Prep & Stakeholder Input (T‑2 Days)**\n| # | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|---|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 6 | Collect **latest dashboard JSON** (`jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`) and clone to safe branch for edits | 2025-07-22 18:00 | Emory | Pull from Git repo or shared doc location. |\n| 7 | Draft **revised Grafana panel configurations** | 2025-07-22 20:00 | Emory | Apply agreed legend reformatting and grouping by `cache_size`. |\n| 8 | Draft initial **alerting PromQL expressions** for: ① thrash warnings, ② resize invocations | 2025-07-22 21:00 | Emory | Base metrics: `jwt_cache_thrash` and `ci_cache_resize_invocations`. |\n| 9 | Share early draft in Teams DM with Shari for ✏️ feedback | 2025-07-22 22:00 | Emory | Request +1 day feedback cycle, async review. |\n\n#### **Phase 4: Alignment Kickoff (Today)**\n| # | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|---|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 10 | Confirm agenda and deliverables with Shari (from event invite) | 2025-07-22 10:00 | Emory | Ensure expectations for stand-up demo content are aligned. |\n| 11 | Check if any **stand-up demo assets** or screenshots are already in progress | 2025-07-22 12:00 | Emory | If not, include this in tomorrow’s dry run plan. |\n\n### ✅ 4. Additional Notes / Assumptions\n- All dates assume **UTC time zone** per meeting invite.  \n- **Dependencies:** JSON edits depend on locating the file; alert rules depend on confirming correct Prometheus labels & metrics in staging.  \n- Meeting objective includes **creating demo screens for Monday’s stand-up** → ensure screenshots/workflow notes are part of dry run.  \n- If any required dataset or query examples are missing from docs, surface blockers to Shari within 24 hours to avoid delays.  \n\n### ✅ 5. Quick Risk Flags\n- **Tight timeline:** Only 2 prep days before final dry run; minimize iteration cycles — async feedback is critical.  \n- **Technical dependencies:** Access to staging Grafana + Prometheus queries must be verified today.  \n- **Action:** If file `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json` is not readily available, request Shari’s copy immediately.  \n\n✅ Do you want me to **also provide a ready-to-use Teams message template to send Shari summarizing this prep plan**?

Review current Grafana dashboard panel JSON (jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json) and threshold color mappings  \n   2. Discuss legend formatting and grouping by `cache_size` labels  \n   3. Iterate on PromQL alert expressions (thrash warnings + resize invocations)  \n   4. Plan demo screens & walkthrough for Monday’s stand-up  \n   5. Identify missing metrics or panel adjustments  \n- **Attachments Provided:** *None explicitly attached to event*, but reference to file: `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json` (dashboard config)  \n- Related responsibilities based on agenda: Pre-read JSON review, PromQL tuning, dashboard modification, alert testing  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 2: Time Remaining & Constraints\n\n- **Meeting in ~7 calendar days**  \n- Tasks like PromQL queries, Grafana dashboard JSON edits, alert rule validation, and demo prep should finish at least 1–2 business days before.\n- Monday stand-up mention suggests **July 21 (Mon)** is a relevant intermediate checkpoint (demo dry run alignment).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 3: High-Level Workback Phases\n\n- **Phase A (July 18–19): Prep & Analysis**\n- **Phase B (July 20–22): Alignment & Refinement**\n- **Phase C (July 23): Final Dry Run & Logistics**\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 4: Detailed Workback Plan (Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes)\n\n| Task                                                                                           | Due Date        | Owner         | Notes / Dependencies                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Confirm file access & pre-read availability**: Ensure `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json` or related Grafana JSON config is accessible. | **Jul 18 (Fri)** | Emory        | Critical first step; needed for reviewing threshold colors & legend setup |\n| **Draft proposed alert tuning plan**: Document current PromQL queries for jwt thrash & CI cache resize; list gaps | **Jul 19 (Sat)** | Emory        | Use historical Prometheus metrics for evaluation if possible |\n| **Share initial observations with Shari via chat/email** | **Jul 19 (Sat) EOD** | Emory | Stakeholder sync to validate direction early |\n| **Prepare revised dashboard JSON mockups**: Include threshold color tweaks & legend grouping changes | **Jul 20 (Sun)** | Emory | Build on review outcome; store in shared repo or send screenshot |\n| **Align on PromQL expression modifications**: Confirm alert rules (warn vs critical) & grouping by labels | **Jul 21 (Mon)** | Emory + Shari | Tie-in with upcoming Monday stand-up; ensure both sign-off |\n| **Conduct quick metrics validation in staging Grafana**: Test new PromQL queries with simulated cache thrash | **Jul 21 (Mon)** | Emory | Depends on Prometheus data & alertmanager config access |\n| **Incorporate feedback & lock final configs (JSON + PromQL)** | **Jul 22 (Tue)** | Emory | Post in Teams for confirmation |\n| **Prepare annotated screenshots & short demo script**: Highlight new thresholds & alert firing conditions | **Jul 23 (Wed)** | Emory | Will be used for the actual 1:1 deep dive session |\n| **Check Teams meeting link & screen share setup** | **Jul 23 (Wed) PM** | Emory | Confirm permissions; reduce risk of tech failure |\n| **Final readiness check**: Ensure dashboards updated in staging, alerts visible & firing in test state | **Jul 24 (Thu) AM** | Emory | Last-mile QA before meeting at 16:00 UTC |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Dependencies & Risk Notes\n- Access to Grafana & Alertmanager is assumed; if blocked, escalate by Jul 18.\n- PromQL edit validation in staging should not break existing production alerts; use temporary alert rules if needed.\n- Monday’s stand-up (Jul 21) serves as soft checkpoint; feedback on design guides final tuning.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Assumptions\n- jwt_cache_thrash/ci_cache_resize metrics & dashboard JSON are in a shared Git repo or available through Grafana UI export.\n- Prometheus and alertmanager configs can be tested in staging without approval bottlenecks.\n- No additional stakeholders need to review beyond Shari.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Recommended Next Step:\n**Immediately**: Confirm access to `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json` and prep current Grafana panel details for review. This unlocks every downstream activity.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a visual Gantt-style timeline** for this workback plan or create a **Teams-task checklist (with due dates)** that you

Review current Grafana dashboard JSON and threshold color mappings (`jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`)  \n    2. Discuss legend formatting and cache_size grouping  \n    3. Iterate on PromQL alert expressions for thrash & resize warnings  \n    4. Plan Monday’s stand-up demo screens  \n    5. Identify missing metrics/panel adjustments  \n\n**Current Time:** July 11, 2025 → **13 days until meeting**  \nThis gives us adequate prep time but note: Stand-up demo mentioned (likely July 28), so dashboard correctness is crucial.\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Artifacts & Grounding References\n- Grafana dash and PromQL adjustments relate to previous performance alerting updates (from Canary & Jitter work).  \n- No direct files attached to this calendar item, but referenced JSON: `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`—likely in your Grafana repository.  \n- Team context shows prior action items for dashboard panel updates (see `TransactionRouter_ConfigDeepDive_Metrics.xlsx`: AI-4 “Update Grafana dashboard panel - Assigned to Porsha (In Progress)”), so align with that work.  \n\n---\n\n## 📅 WORKBACK PLAN (Anchored to **Thursday, July 24 @ 16:00 UTC**)\n\n### **Phase 1: Preparation (Farther from meeting)**  \n**Task:** Gather baseline artifacts  \n- **Due:** July 15 (T-9 days)  \n- **Owner:** Emory *(you)*  \n- **Notes:** Pull current dashboard JSON (`jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`), alert rules YAML, and last known thresholds. Confirm location in Grafana repo and export for offline review.\n\n**Task:** Align with related panel updates from Router Config work  \n- **Due:** July 16 (T-8 days)  \n- **Owner:** Emory  \n- **Notes:** Sync with Porsha or check status of Action Item “Finalize Grafana perf panel” from config deep dive. Ensure no conflicts with current dashboard schema.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Drafting & Review**  \n**Task:** Identify key metrics & missing panels  \n- **Due:** July 18 (T-6 days)  \n- **Owner:** Emory  \n- **Notes:** Based on agenda item #5, ensure jwt_cache_thrash and ci_cache_resize_invocations metrics exist; list any new ones needed.\n\n**Task:** Prepare PromQL expressions to discuss  \n- **Due:** July 19 (T-5 days)  \n- **Owner:** Emory  \n- **Notes:** Draft new/revised queries for thrash warnings and resize invocations. Validate against staging Grafana/Prometheus data.\n\n**Task:** Draft color thresholds & legend grouping suggestions  \n- **Due:** July 20 (T-4 days)  \n- **Owner:** Emory  \n- **Notes:** Make a mock screenshot or simple doc with thresholds and legend format for cache_size label grouping.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Pre-Meeting Checks**  \n**Task:** Share pre-read pack with Shari  \n- **Due:** July 22 (T-2 days)  \n- **Owner:** Emory  \n- **Notes:** Combine findings (dash JSON, threshold plan, PromQL snippets) into a short doc or link. Send via Teams chat to confirm agenda alignment.\n\n**Task:** Tech check for call  \n- **Due:** July 23 (T-1 day)  \n- **Owner:** Emory  \n- **Notes:** Ensure access to Grafana during call for live edits/queries. Test Teams link.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Meeting Day (July 24)**  \n**Task:** Finalize any new metrics queries in local notes  \n- **Due:** Morning of July 24  \n- **Owner:** Emory  \n- **Notes:** Prep quick commands to pull updated Prometheus data for discussion if needed.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Assumptions & Risks\n- No file attachment confirmed in event, but JSON file reference (`jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`) assumed to be in managed repo.\n- Porsha’s dashboard-related action might overlap—coordinate to avoid duplicate edits.\n- If Monday stand-up demo is July 28, buffer time after this meeting is only 4 business days.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Deliverables Before Meeting\n- Exported dashboard JSON & screenshots  \n- Draft PromQL expressions  \n- Threshold color logic & grouping plan  \n- Pre-read doc (share by July 22)\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a Teams task list** for this workback plan and/or create a **calendar reminder for each milestone**?",

Confirm Mockup Scope & Gather Latest Figma Files** | **2025-07-17 (EOD)** | Shakia | Pull latest frames from `bankconnect-ui` project; confirm versions with Shari |\n| **2. Draft Compliance Checklist (PSD2 & PCI-DSS) for UI Elements** | **2025-07-18 (Noon)** | Shakia | Use language from [CONTRIBUTING.md updates mentioned in past compliance work], adapt display naming approach |\n| **3. Review and Flag Edge Cases with Annotated Comments in Figma** | **2025-07-18 (EOD)** | Shari | Focus on IBAN, routingNumber, cardPan entry flows, error banners |\n| **4.

Minimal buffer; delays in mockup feedback compress dry-run prep.\n- Only **two attendees**, so alignment should be quick → Risk: compliance review might need SME input; schedule early if needed.\n- Current context shows prior strict compliance gates (FISMA SI-10, display naming), anticipate similar rigor here.\n- No relevant files surfaced for this meeting beyond the Figma link; treat as primary artifact.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Best Practices Applied\n- Backward scheduling from fixed meeting date  \n- Included agenda alignment & compliance validation milestones  \n- Buffer tasks (pre-read circulation + dry run)  \n- Clear dependencies & responsible owner  \n\n---\n\n#### ✅ Next Step for You:\n**Start with Task #1 today:** confirm the latest Figma mockups and scope with Shari.\n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to **generate this as a shareable timeline (Gantt-style table) in Markdown**, or **prepare an Outlook/Teams task list you can copy-paste into Planner**?",

Review timeline and root cause analysis for payments-api spike  \n  2. Discuss incident routing updates  \n  3. Assign follow-up actions for threshold and dashboard updates  \n- **Location:** Teams Meeting (link in event)  \n- **Attachments:** *None listed in event*  \n- **Slack/Email/FYI:** Recent threads and docs primarily relate to feature-flag infrastructure—**not directly tied** to this meeting.  \n\n---\n\n### ⏳ Time Remaining: ~15 hours (including overnight if in PDT). This is an **aggressive** timeline → minimalistic, focused tasks.\n\n---\n\n## **Workback Plan: “On-call Incident Review: Payments-API Spike”**\n*(Meeting is July 23 @10:15 AM PDT. All tasks must complete before that.)*\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Pre-read & Analysis Prep (Tonight)**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Gather incident data (timeline, logs, alert triggers) | **Jul 22, 7:30 PM PDT** | You (Shari) in sync with Nila T. | Pull data from monitoring dashboards, incident tickets. Dependencies: latest alert logs from Eng. |\n| Draft root cause summary (1-pager) | **Jul 22, 9:00 PM PDT** | Nila Tanguma | Extract “why spike” root cause, validated vs incident timeline. Keep short for 30-min call. |\n| Outline incident metrics (threshold breaches, error rates) | **Jul 22, 9:30 PM PDT** | Era Manteca | Pull from Prometheus/Grafana or internal dashboards. Highlight the peak period. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Agenda Finalization & Pre-read Distribution**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Confirm agenda alignment with incident scope | **Jul 22, 10:00 PM PDT** | Shari Jatho | Agenda from event: OK, just verify priority order: Root Cause → Routing Updates → Next Actions. |\n| Package summary deck or doc (timeline + RC + metrics) | **Jul 22, 10:30 PM PDT** | Shari + Nila | Use minimalistic structure (3 slides or 1 doc). Title: *Payments-API Spike Review*. |\n| Send pre-read to attendees (via Outlook or Teams) | **Jul 22, 11:00 PM PDT** | Shari Jatho | Attach doc/deck and agenda in meeting chat or email. Mark urgency: “Review ahead of call.” |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Logistics Check**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Validate Teams link and recording setup | **Jul 22, 11:15 PM PDT** | Shari | Ensure link works. Enable recording for accountability. |\n| Verify attendee availability | **Jul 22, 11:30 PM PDT** | Shari | Quick check in Teams chat: confirm critical roles (Eng Manager, PM). |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Day-of Meeting Quick Prep**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Join 10 mins early for audio/tech check | **Jul 23, 10:05 AM PDT** | Shari | Test screen share for doc/deck. |\n| Have escalation contacts ready | **Jul 23, before call** | Shari / Cortez Dehn | If dashboard fix decisions require routing approvals. |\n\n---\n\n## 📌 **Post-Meeting (for reference)**\n- Consolidate action items & owners in Teams immediately after call.\n- Send summary email within 1 hour of meeting end.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Assumptions & Risks\n- No supporting doc existed in grounding data, so **pre-read will be created from scratch tonight**.\n- No evidence of root cause doc—**high risk of incomplete input if engineering doesn’t respond quickly**. Mitigate by pinging Nila and Cortez immediately.\n- Tight timeline: **leverage overlap with PST evening**—send reminders that reading doc is critical before 10:00 AM call.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Visual Timeline (PDT)\n```\nJul 22\n7:30 PM   Gather incident data  [Nila/You]\n9:00 PM   Draft RC summary      [Nila]\n9:30 PM   Metrics view ready    [Era]\n10:00 PM  Finalize agenda\n10:30 PM  Package

Review timeline and root cause analysis for payments-api spike  \n   2. Discuss incident routing updates  \n   3. Assign follow-up actions for threshold and dashboard updates  \n\n**Implication:** This is a high-priority, incident-focused meeting with minimal prep time. We must compress the timeline and front-load critical steps.\n\n---\n\n## **Workback Plan (starting from meeting date: Jul 23, 10:15 AM PDT)**\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Hour Before Meeting (Day of Meeting)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Finalize root cause brief** | **Jul 23, 09:30 PDT** | *Era Manteca / Dev Team (TBD)* | Include: incident timeline, cause of spike, remediation steps. Summarize in 1–2 slides or bullet points. |\n| **Confirm Teams link accessibility & screen share permissions** | Jul 23, 09:30 PDT | *Shari Jatho* | Ensure no tech blockers; test link in advance. |\n| **Prepare quick-reference incident metrics** | Jul 23, 09:45 PDT | *Terina Hafen + Cortez Dehn* | Focus on alert triggers, threshold breaches, and dashboard logs. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Early Morning Prep (2–3 hrs before meeting)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Package pre-read summary of incident findings** | Jul 23, 07:30 PDT | *Loria Furlan (you)* | Extract from logs, RCA notes; upload to Teams chat or email attendees. If time-constrained, provide top 3 insights and major questions. |\n| **Draft follow-up action template** | Jul 23, 08:00 PDT | *Ashley Engel* | Prepare a simple table: Action, Owner, ETA. Share in meeting for live capture. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Night Before Meeting (Tonight – Jul 22)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Collect incident data and timeline from DevOps** | Jul 22, EOD (local) | *Cortez Dehn + Tisa Odonoghue* | Pull from monitoring dashboards, alert history. Provide key sequence of events and attach logs if possible. |\n| **Validate proposed routing updates for incidents** | Jul 22, 22:00 PDT | *Nila Tanguma* | Ensure feasible escalation path changes; note any tool/process blockers. |\n| **Sync with organizer on updated agenda & priorities** | Jul 22, 21:30 PDT | *Loria Furlan ↔ Shari Jatho* | Confirm: any new discussion points (e.g., customer impact, fix progress). |\n\n---\n\n## **Key Constraints & Assumptions**  \n- Only ~12–13 hours remain until the meeting. Plan assumes immediate after-hours coordination.  \n- Owners are based on roles inferred from attendee list; confirm responsibilities quickly.  \n- If required details (e.g., RCA owner) are unclear, escalate to Engineering Manager (Nila Tanguma).  \n- Communication channel: Use Teams chat for real-time updates and file sharing.  \n- *Assumption:* All attendees can access monitoring tools; if not, pair roles with SMEs who can pull data fast.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Pre-meeting Deliverables**  \n- **RCA Summary** (1-pager): Causes & mitigation  \n- **Metrics Snapshot**: Key incident KPIs  \n- **Follow-up Action Template** ready for live edit during meeting  \n\n---\n\n✅ This plan focuses on **compressed turnaround**, given the proximity of the meeting and its high urgency.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n- **Generate a Teams message draft** to rally the attendees with these prep tasks and responsibilities?  \nOR  \n- **Create a structured one-pager in Word/Teams Wiki

Secure default value integration in **Vault KV references** (version:2 enforcement)  \n  2. JSON Schema patch for `maxReceiveMessageSize` under `grpcInterceptor.properties`  \n  3. YAML naming conventions migration (camelCase → kebab-case) and indentation rules  \n  4. Pipeline validation staging job setup for schema checks  \n  5. Next steps and action items assignment  \n- **Attachments Provided:**  \n  - `Config_Change_Log.xlsx`  \n  - `Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx`  \n\n### Time Context\n- **Today:** July 18, 2025 (01:00 AM)  \n- **Time until meeting:** ~6 days  \n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Relevant Context from Grounding Data\nThis is a **DevOps-focused deep dive** on **secure config defaults, Vault KV integration, and YAML naming conventions**. Organizer Tisa appears to expect:\n- Pre-read of config change logs  \n- Familiarity with **secure defaults guide**  \n- Ability to discuss validation strategies for pipeline schema checks (likely referencing Jenkins DSL patterns you were working on in your recent email thread about `validatePipelineSchema`)  \n\nThese attachments are **critical pre-reads**. No other participants are listed, so the prep is likely between you and Tisa, making focused document review and any questions essential for alignment.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Timeline (Starting from July 24 Meeting – Working Backward)\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Preparation (Day of Meeting)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Join Teams meeting: review agenda and confirm Teams link | **July 24, 4:45 PM PST** | Nila | Confirm no connectivity issues; meeting link in event details |\n| Have `Config_Change_Log.xlsx` and `Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx` open for quick reference | July 24 | Nila | Highlight Vault KV defaults enforcement section |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Dry-Run Review**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Summarize key talking points: Vault KV setup, YAML naming rules, pipeline schema validation snippet | **July 23 (EOD)** | Nila | Base summary on Secure Defaults guide & your prior pipeline interface examples |\n| Identify any blockers/questions (e.g., JSON schema patch process) | July 23 | Nila | Email Tisa if clarifications needed before meeting |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Core Prep & Inputs**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Review `Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx`: focus on Vault KV v2 enforcement and YAML naming recommendations | **July 22** | Nila | Note action items for YAML migration impact |\n| Analyze `Config_Change_Log.xlsx`: locate recent schema changes, verify `maxReceiveMessageSize` patch | July 22 | Nila | Cross-reference with Jenkins pipeline validation logic |\n| Revisit your pipeline snippet drafts (`validatePipelineSchema`, thresholds) from recent email thread | July 21 | Nila | Ensure your perspective aligns with meeting goals |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Logistics & Confirmation**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm calendar reminder and ensure Teams access | **July 20** | Nila | Double-check meeting is on your schedule |\n| Ensure you have access to attachments (`Config_Change_Log.xlsx`, `Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx`) in SharePoint | July 20 | Nila | Download offline copies to avoid connectivity issues |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Key Dependencies\n- Attachments availability (already present in the event)  \n- No response delays if clarification is required (plan to email Tisa by July 23 if needed)  \n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Assumptions & Risks\n- Only one scheduled attendee besides you (Tisa); plan assumes this is primarily an **information alignment and technical review**, not a cross-functional decision session.  \n- No additional materials beyond the provided two attachments are mentioned; if new docs arrive, review timeline may compress.  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary Checklist**\n- **By Jul 20:** Event logistics confirmed + access to materials ✅  \n- **By Jul 22:** Deep review of attachments completed ✅  \n- **By Jul 23:** Questions to Tisa (if any), talking points prepared ✅  \n- **Day of (Jul 24):** Be online 15 mins early with files open ✅  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n✅ **Generate a OneNote-ready version of this plan** for quick updates,  \n✅ **Add a checklist in Teams Planner**, or  \n✅ **Create an email draft summarizing this timeline to Tisa for alignment?**", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should state the meeting [SUBJECT], [DATE/TIME], [TIMEZONE], and

**Jul 11** (today) | Tisa | Done after this response! ✔ |\n\n---\n\n#### ⛔ Risks & Notes\n- **Weekend buffer:** Allow margin for unexpected requests; finalize major content by Jul 21.\n- **Attachments are key:** Use `Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx` for secure defaults and `Config_Change_Log.xlsx` for patch history.\n- No explicit dry-run needed; meeting is discussion-based but **structured notes will help**.\n- If additional stakeholders need summary, schedule async update after Jul 24 (not in scope for current meeting).\n\n---\n\n### ✅ At a Glance:\n- **Jul 16–17:** Share docs & solicit feedback.\n- **Jul 18–21:** Finalize inputs and agenda.\n- **Jul 23:** Send pre-meeting reminder and validate setup.\n- **Jul 24:** Execute meeting smoothly.\n\n---\n\n➡ **Would you like me to also create a *templated agenda document* (with placeholders for each of the 5 bullets in the official agenda) to share in advance OR draft the email reminder including pre-read links?**  \n*(I can do both if helpful.)*", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should include a backward timeline from T₀ with dependency-aware sequencing and

Based on workshop name, objective is to finalize CVSS threshold values for security scoring tuned to org policy.  \n- **Related Resources Found:**  \n    - Security workshops & workshops planning context found in **UnitTestWorkshop_PlanningDocument.docx**.  \n    - Recent files on risk/security alignment: *ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx* and *Resilience_Security_Synergy_Study.pdf* indicate similar domain context (security thresholds, vulnerability assessment).  \n    - No explicit attachment for CVSS workshop → agenda/prereads need creation.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Assumptions (Explicitly Noted)**\n- Attendee list and CVSS draft thresholds need confirmation (not present in data).\n- Technical setup similar to other workshops (Teams + Conference room).\n- Objectives: finalize CVSS threshold bands (critical/high/medium/low scoring), align thresholds to risk posture and compliance requirements.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Planning Horizon**\n- Workshop is in **~10 working days** (excluding weekends).\n- Timeline is **tight**, requires efficient execution of prerequisites.\n\n---\n\n## **Workback Timeline**\n\n### **Phase 1 | Finalization Workshop Day (Event)**\n**📅 July 30 (Wed), 10:00 AM PST**  \n**CVSS Threshold Finalization Workshop** *(30 mins)*  \n- *Ensure Tech Setup verified by T-1 day.*  \n- Output goal: Official CVSS scoring thresholds approved and documented.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2 | Final Review & Deck Freeze**\n**📅 July 28 (Mon)**  \n**Task:** Finalize workshop deck, freeze logistics  \n- **Owner:** Shakia  \n- **Dependencies:** Inputs incorporated from security, compliance teams  \n- **Notes:** Upload final deck to Teams & SharePoint; test Teams link + screen share.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3 | Dry Run & Confirmation**\n**📅 July 25 (Fri)**  \n**Task:** Conduct internal dry run of CVSS deck + key talking points  \n- **Owner:** Shakia  \n- **Notes:** Validate threshold proposal scenarios; ensure meeting flow hits 30-min constraint.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4 | Draft Agenda + Circulate Pre-Read**\n**📅 July 22 (Tue)**  \n**Task 1:** Draft meeting agenda and objectives (explicit)  \n- **Owner:** Shakia  \n- **Notes:** Include bullet topics: Current CVSS scoring gaps, proposed threshold matrix (e.g., Critical ≥9.0, High ≥7.0).  \n**Task 2:** Compile pre-read packet  \n- Include:  \n  - *ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx* highlight of current vuln severity distribution  \n  - Extract from *Resilience_Security_Synergy_Study.pdf* on impact of severity thresholds on alerting  \n- Convert to PDF and share via Outlook/Teams.  \n- Add “Pre-read required by July 27” note.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5 | Stakeholder Inputs**\n**📅 July 18–21 (Fri–Mon)**  \n**Task:** Collect stakeholder input on draft thresholds (Slack/Teams poll or email)  \n- **Owner:** Shakia  \n- **Dependencies:** Initial CVSS proposal prepared by Shakia (based on NIST CVSS v3.x + internal compliance needs)  \n- **Notes:** Validate compliance with FISMA SI-10 & LiveOak internal risk guidelines.  \n\n---\n\n### **Phase 6 | Initial Prep**\n**📅 July 17 (Thu)**  \n**Task:** Kick-off prep session (solo)  \n- **Owner:** Shakia  \n- Action items:  \n  - Draft CVSS proposal doc (start with NIST scale, adjust for LiveOak specifics)  \n  - Identify relevant data: severity findings (ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx), vulnerability exposure stats  \n  - Set up workshop folder in SharePoint: `/security/workshops/CVSS_Threshold_Finalization`\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Task                                         | Due Date    | Owner    | Notes                                           |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 📝 Draft CVSS proposal + folder setup       | Jul 17    | Shakia  | Use ChaosAssessment.xlsx & SynergyStudy.pdf     |\n| ✅ Collect stakeholder feedback             | Jul 18-21 | Shakia  | Use Teams poll, email, focus on critical gaps   |\n| 📄 Agenda drafted + pre-read packet shared  | Jul 22    | Shakia  | Include risk analysis + threshold mapping       |\n| 🔍 Dry run w/ internal review              | Jul 25    | Shakia  | Validate timing + talking points                |\n| 📂 Final deck + logistics freeze           | Jul 28    | Shakia  | Upload to Teams, confirm tech setup             |\n| 🎯 CVSS Threshold Finalization Workshop     | Jul 30    | Shakia  | 10:00 AM PST via Teams                          |\n\n---\n\n## **Special Notes**\n- ✅ **Dependencies:** Pre-read readiness is critical for meaningful discussion in such a short call (30 mins).\n- ❗ Risk: Tight turnaround—missing Jul 22 pre-read milestone jeopardizes stakeholder prep.\n- ➡ Mitigation: Pre-draft thresholds early (Jul 17) so feedback window remains open.\n\n---\n\n### 🔑 **Next Steps for You**\n- Confirm attendee list & add Teams link in invite by **Jul 17 PM**.\n- Begin drafting CVSS threshold proposal immediately (align with LiveOak vulnerability distribution data).\n- I can prepare a **template email for pre-read distribution** or **create a one-slide CVSS summary matrix** if you’d like.\n\n---\n\n✅ Would you like me to **(a)** generate the **agenda draft**, **(b)** prepare the **CVSS threshold reference sheet from your security assessment files**, or **(c)** draft the **Teams pre-read email now**?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id":

Deck (initial):** `JwtCache_Metrics_DeepDive_Slides.pptx`\n- **Metrics Source:** Jenkins integration test pass-rate dashboard & Prometheus JWT cache counters\n- **Prior Work:** CI pipeline YAML validation threads (Teams), Jira epics on metrics auto-scaling\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation\n- **Tight Prep Window:** Only 2.5 days → Build parallel tracks: Shakia updates slides while Emory/Era focus on data verification.\n- **CI Instability Risk:** Lock pipeline after July 24 EOD UTC to prevent last-minute metric drift.\n- **Attendee Availability:** Conflicts likely → Send pre-read + async

We need to ensure pre-reads and inputs are ready by July 23 at the latest to leave time for final QA and distribution.\n\n---\n\n## **WORKBACK PLAN**  \n*(Backward from July 25 meeting date)*  \n\n---\n\n### **Meeting Date: Friday, July 25, 2025**\n- **Task:** Conduct meeting and facilitate discussion  \n- **Owner:** Shakia Gencarelli  \n- **Notes:** Ensure recording enabled, capture assigned action items for alert tuning and CI coverage.\n\n---\n\n### **T–1 Day: July 24, 2025**\n- **Task:** Final logistics check and rehearsals  \n- **Owner:** Organizer (Shakia) with DevOps support  \n- **Notes:**  \n  - Verify Teams link and screen-sharing works  \n  - Confirm all attendees have latest slides and pre-read materials  \n  - Dry-run PromQL dashboards if demo planned  \n\n---\n\n### **T–2 Days: July 23, 2025**\n- **Task:** Distribute pre-read package to all attendees  \n- **Owner:** Shakia Gencarelli  \n- **Dependencies:** Slides and dashboard screenshots finalized  \n- **Notes:**  \n  - Attachment: `JwtCache_Metrics_DeepDive_Slides.pptx`  \n  - Include Grafana snapshots, thrash warning trend graphs, latency charts  \n\n---\n\n### **T–3 Days: July 22, 2025**\n- **Task:** Finalize meeting deck & metrics snapshots  \n- **Owner:** Era Manteca (metrics charts), Shakia Gencarelli (deck review)  \n- **Dependencies:** CI run results imported into deck  \n- **Notes:** Ensure before/after optimization charts (p50/p95 latency) and cache thrash counter anomalies annotated clearly  \n\n---\n\n### **T–4 Days: July 21, 2025**\n- **Task:** Confirm PromQL alert queries & Grafana dashboard consistency  \n- **Owner:** Wilford Taussig *(Prometheus rules)* and Emory Scherping *(Grafana panels)*  \n- **Dependencies:** Integration test data from latest CI pipeline run  \n- **Notes:**  \n  - Check alert thresholds for cache thrash warnings and eviction anomalies  \n  - Validate recorded rules like `cache:thrash_warnings:sum` and associated alert firing conditions  \n\n---\n\n### **T–5 Days: July 19–20 (Weekend)**\n- **Optional buffer:** Heavy updates avoided  \n- Use for asynchronous prep (slide text refinement, metric review) as needed  \n\n---\n\n### **T–6 Days: July 18 (Today EOD)**\n- **Task:** Kick-off prep and assign roles for deliverables  \n- **Owner:** Organizer (Shakia)  \n- **Notes:**  \n  - Confirm owners for metrics validation, deck, and alert rule updates  \n  - Circulate timeline + expectations in Teams  \n  - Gather initial inputs from CI logs, forced eviction test outcomes  \n\n---\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| **Task**                                              | **Due Date**  | **Owner**               | **Notes**                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Kick-off prep & assign roles                         | Jul 18 (EOD) | Shakia                  | Share plan and delegate tasks            |\n| Validate dashboards & PromQL alerts                  | Jul 21       | Wilford & Emory         | Ensure alert rules for cache thrash OK   |\n| Finalize deck & embed performance metrics            | Jul 22       | Era & Shakia            | Include latency before/after charts      |\n| Send pre-reads (deck, screenshots)                   | Jul 23       | Shakia                  | Email attachments + Teams post           |\n| Tech dry-run & meeting checklist                     | Jul 24       | Shakia                  | Test screen share and confirm attendance |\n| Meeting: JWT Cache Metrics & Integration Test Deep Dive | Jul 25       | Shakia (Facilitator)    | Capture action items, record session     |\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Dependencies**\n- **Metrics availability:** Forced eviction integration test pass rates must be pulled from CI success logs before Jul 21  \n- **Dashboard alignment:** Grafana panels and Prometheus thresholds finalized before deck completion  \n- **Pre-read timeliness:** Send Jul 23 to allow questions before session  \n\n---\n\n### **Risks & Mitigations**\n- **Tight prep window:** Assign clear owners with rapid async updates  \n- **Metric pipeline delays:** Build contingency by extracting last successful CI run artifacts if latest not ready  \n- **Attendee unavailability:** Share recording if someone cannot join  \n\n---\n\n✅ **Assumptions:**  \n- No public holiday constraints during prep week  \n- All attendees have Teams access & permissions for Grafana dashboards  \n- No major architectural rework required before meeting  \n\n---\n\n#### 📌 Next Step:  \nWould you like me to **generate a shareable one-pager (PDF)** version of this workback plan that includes assigned owners and file/resource links for quick distribution to your team?  \nOr prepare a **Teams message draft** to quickly align attendees on this plan?", "assertions":

Review JWT cache thrash warning counter trends & alert configs  \n  2. Deep dive into forced eviction integration test outcomes & CI pass rates  \n  3. Analyze performance metrics (p50/p95 before & after optimization)  \n  4. Discuss enhancements to metrics instrumentation & PromQL rules  \n  5. Assign next steps for metric auto-scaling & alert tuning  \n- **Attachment:** `JwtCache_Metrics_DeepDive_Slides.pptx`  \n\n*No assumptions needed for date/time — fully confirmed.*  \n\n---\n\n### 📅 Time Remaining\nMeeting is on **July 25**, request made on **July 18 PM (+8)** → **~6 full working days**.  \nPlan needs to be aggressive but realistic.  \n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Workback Plan Timeline: From July 25 (Meeting Day) Backward\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Pre-Meeting Tasks**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Finalize slide deck `JwtCache_Metrics_DeepDive_Slides.pptx` with updated charts, CI pass-rate tables | **July 24 (EOD UTC)** | Shakia Gencarelli | Ensure latest metrics and integration test results are reflected |\n| Distribute final agenda & deck to attendees | **July 24 (EOD UTC)** | Rufina Ganie | Attach deck link in Teams meeting chat + email |\n| Confirm Teams meeting link active & screen-share permissions verified | **July 24** | Emory Scherping | Double-check with IT if link requires refresh |\n| Dry run (optional but recommended) | **July 24 (AM UTC)** | Shakia + Era + Emory | Quick sync to ensure flows and transitions are clear |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Core Preparation Work**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Pull latest JWT cache thrash metrics & alert config snapshots | **July 23** | Emory Scherping | Export Prometheus panels or Grafana screenshots for inclusion in deck |\n| Compile forced eviction integration test report (CI data) | **July 23** | Era Manteca | Verify data covers pass/fail rates & any flakiness patterns |\n| Merge any pending metric instrumentation PRs into `develop` branch & log tracking IDs | **July 22** | Rufina Ganie (you) | Ensure code state matches assumptions for analysis |\n| Validate aggregated p50/p95 latency and compare pre/post optimization stats | **July 22** | Emory Scherping | Use staging run logs and Micrometer/PromQL queries |\n| Draft early version of slide deck `JwtCache_Metrics_DeepDive_Slides.pptx` | **July 21** | Shakia Gencarelli | Include placeholders for charts and analysis tables |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Input Gathering & Alignment**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Collect attendee input on preliminary metrics and problem statements | **July 20** | Rufina Ganie | Use Teams chat or shared doc for feedback |\n| Confirm agenda alignment & objectives with organizer | **July 19** | Rufina Ganie | Quick check-in with Shakia to validate scope |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Today + Immediate Actions**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Kick off prep sync thread in Teams with all attendees | **July 18 (today)** | Rufina Ganie | Drop message summarizing timeline and responsibilities |\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Dependencies & Risk Mitigation\n- **Dependencies:** Deck finalization depends on Emory & Era delivering metrics and CI test data by July 23.  \n- **Risks:** Metrics gathering could be delayed if PromQL queries fail → Have Emory schedule queries overnight from July 21 to allow buffer.  \n- **Buffer:** 1 day buffer before meeting (July 24) for consolidation and rehearsal.  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Success Criteria Before Meeting\n✔ Deck is up-to-date with accurate metrics and CI pass rate tables.  \n✔ All attendees have pre-read materials by EOD July 24.  \n✔ Teams link and recording permissions have been tested.  \n✔ Everyone is aligned on discussion points (no surprises).  \n\n---\n\n### Why this is Practical:\n- You have 6 working days → Plan spreads tasks logically with a reserved day for final checks.  \n- Responsibilities match attendee expertise from grounding data (Emory for metrics, Era for CI, you for alignment & PR merges).  \n\n---\n\n👉 **Next Step for You (Rufina):** Post kickoff message today summarizing above timeline in Teams chat and start aligning data owners.  \n\n---\n\n✅ **Do you want me to also generate a Teams-ready message that summarizes this workback plan for your project group chat?**", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "",

Review updated CVE remediation timelines (see `ExecSummary_v2.pdf`) and Jenkins pipeline gate progress.  \n    2. Confirm integration approach for Trivy JSON scan exit codes in Jenkinsfile.  \n    3. Align next sprint dependency upgrade tasks and Jira assignments (e.g., SEC-503, SEC-504).  \n    4. Validate Grafana alert threshold changes and runbook link references.  \n- **Relevant Files:**  \n    - `ExecSummary_v2.pdf` (updated remediation timeline & CVE table)  \n    - `ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx` (finding summary, CVE remediation actions, Jira SEC-501/503 context)  \n\n**Current time:** 2025-06-28T18:00:00+08:00 → **~14 hours before the meeting.**  \nThis is an extremely tight timeline, so tasks focus on essential deliverables.\n\n---\n\n# 📅 Workback Plan: 1:1 Deep Dive – Security Remediation Roadmap  \n*(Meeting: June 29, 2025, 10:00 UTC)*  \n\n### **Finalization Phase (Last 12–18 Hours)**  \n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| **Confirm Latest Remediation Summary** | June 28, 22:00 UTC | Terina | Review `ExecSummary_v2.pdf` for accuracy: check updated CVE table, remediation timelines, and Jira SEC-503/504 alignment. |\n| **Validate Jenkins Pipeline Gate Status** | June 28, 22:30 UTC | Shakia | Confirm integration of Trivy JSON scan exit codes and security gate behaviors; pull metrics from **Jenkinsfile.security.groovy** update. |\n| **Sync Jira Assignments (SEC-503, SEC-504)** | June 28, 23:00 UTC | Terina & Shakia | Align next sprint owner/timelines for dependency upgrades and latency threshold PRs; verify tickets exist and are in correct status. |\n| **Finalize Discussion Draft (Highlights & Open Questions)** | June 28, 23:30 UTC | Terina | Summarize: ✔ key remediation milestones ✔ pipeline outcomes ✔ unresolved blockers.

call. |\n\n---\n\n## **Key Dependencies**\n- **`ExecSummary_v2.pdf`** is critical for the first agenda item — ensure reviewed and accurate before distributing.  \n- Jenkins & Grafana checks depend on most recent deployments (check recent commits/alerts from feature branches).  \n- Time buffer for unforeseen blockers: **minimal (~1 hr)** given tight window; prioritize agenda-critical items.\n\n---\n\n## **Assumptions & Risk Notes**\n- Meeting time is confirmed as per Event data: **June 29, 10:00 UTC**.\n- No weekend blackout restrictions apply (Sunday for UTC; local time differences considered).\n- If any Jira ticket status is unclear, capture notes and bring them as open questions rather than delaying sync.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Quick Delivery Checklist Before Meeting\n- ✔ `ExecSummary_v2.pdf` verified & shared  \n- ✔ Jenkins security gate status confirmed  \n- ✔ Jira SEC-503/504 assignments aligned  \n- ✔ Grafana alert thresholds cross-verified  \n- ✔ All links prepared for screen-share/demo\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n✅ **Create a one-page visual timeline (Gantt-style) for these tasks**  \nor  \n✅ **Generate a quick “Pre-Read Email Draft” that bundles

Cross-reference any mention of observability_config.yaml if relevant. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Pre-Read Delivery & Confirmation**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Send pre-read summary email to Terina | **June 28, 23:00** | Shakia | Summarize: reviewed Exec Summary, validated JIRA tickets & pipeline configs, list any open questions. Include link to `ExecSummary_v2.pdf` for reference. |\n| Prep quick-reference notes for meeting | **Before sleep (June 29, 00:00 latest)** | Shakia | Highlight agenda items + conclusions so far.

29, 09:30 UTC** | Shakia | Last-minute status check to ensure talking points are current. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Assumptions & Risks\n- Assumption: Only you (Shakia) are preparing; no delegate.\n- Risk: Short prep window; parallelize small tasks and prioritize Exec Summary + JIRA updates first.\n- If new blockers arise (e.g., unable to locate Jenkinsfile branch), flag during pre-read email, not in live call.\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Recommended Focus Areas During Meeting\n- Clarify any ambiguity in remediation timelines.\n- Validate Trivy JSON integration approach before pipeline lock-in next sprint.\n- Confirm Grafana thresholds align with latest observability config and no regressions introduced in runbooks.\n\n---\n\n### ✔ Output Snapshot\n\n**Due in next 5 hours (hard priority):**\n- Review Exec Summary\n- Draft talking points\n- Validate Jenkins & Grafana context\n- Email recap to Terina\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **(a)** draft the pre-read summary email for Terina based on the agenda

attendee besides organizer → prep is lightweight, but accuracy in security data is critical.\n- Dependencies:\n  - Updated Grafana alert thresholds must be validated before final Exec Summary update.\n  - Jenkins pipeline verification (Trivy integration) is key for meeting agenda #2.\n- Risk Mitigation:\n  - Send reminders early if CI pipeline changes appear delayed.\n  - Have backup metrics screenshots in case Grafana dashboards experience latency.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Why this matters:\nThis plan ensures all **CI/CD security gates**, **Trivy scan logic**, and **Grafana alert adjustments** are reviewed before the session, and the **Executive Summary** is accurate and approved.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a companion pre-read summary (1-page executive recap)**

That’s ~16 hours to prep, considering global distribution and likely sleep hours for PST-based team.\n- Use UTC baseline:  \n  - **Now:** Jul 26 14:00 UTC  \n  - **Meeting:** Jul 27 14:00 UTC  \n- Workback requires overnight effort or early morning tasks. Assign tasks immediately after creation.\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 **Workback Plan (Backwards from Meeting)**\n\n---\n\n#### **T0: Meeting Time**\n- **July 27, 14:00 UTC — Meeting “Dynamic Cache Resizing and Metrics Deep Dive”**\n  - ✅ Deliverables ready for live discussion.\n\n---\n\n### **Finalization Phase**\n| **Task** | **Due** | **Owner(s)** | **Notes / Dependencies** |\n|----------|---------|-------------|---------------------------|\n| **Finalize discussion deck & include latest charts** | **Jul 27, 11:00 UTC (3h pre-meeting)** | Shakia Gencarelli | Pull content from `DynamicCacheResizing_Prototype_DeepDive.docx` + latest Grafana panels + Jenkins pipeline snippet for HPA params. |\n| **Validate MS Teams meeting link & confirm tech check** | **Jul 27, 11:30 UTC** | Emory Scherping | Ensure camera/mic + share permission OK; cross-check access for Rufina and Era. |\n\n---\n\n### **Pre-Read Distribution**\n| **Task** | **Due** | **Owner(s)** | **Notes** |\n|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Send pre-read email with attached doc & agenda** | **Jul 27, 07:00 UTC (7h pre-meeting)** | Shakia Gencarelli | Attach: `DynamicCacheResizing_Prototype_DeepDive.docx`; include callout to alert rules and CI pipeline updates. |\n\n---\n\n### **Dry Run & Metrics Validation**\n| **Task** | **Due** | **Owner(s)** | **Notes / Dependencies** |\n|----------|---------|-------------|---------------------------|\n| **Test Prometheus/Grafana panels (ci_cache_resize_invocations_total)** | **Jul 27, 06:00 UTC** | Emory Scherping | Confirm thresholds: `increase(ci_cache_resize_invocations_total[5m]) > 5`; screenshot charts for deck. |\n| **Validate Jenkins pipeline HPA parameter injection** | **Jul 27, 06:30 UTC** | Markita Sitra | From pipeline branch `feature/hpa-params`; confirm parameter defaults (MAX_PARALLEL_CHAOS_PODS, HPA_CPU_TARGET). |\n\n---\n\n### **Document Review & Feedback Integration**\n| **Task** | **Due** | **Owner(s)** | **Notes** |\n|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Incorporate feedback on resizing thresholds & alerting rules** | **Jul 27, 03:00 UTC** | Rufina Ganie, Era Manteca | Review `DynamicCacheResizing_Prototype_DeepDive.docx` sections on thresholds and synthetic load test results. |\n\n---\n\n### **Overnight Prep (Immediately Next Steps)**\n| **Task** | **Due** | **Owner(s)** | **Notes** |\n|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Merge PR #472 for dynamic resizing into staging branch** | **Jul 26, 23:00 UTC** | Shakia Gencarelli | Required for test runs and metric validation. Mentioned in Shari’s July 26 email. |\n| **Trigger final CI pipeline run & collect logs** | **Jul 26, 23:30 UTC** | Emory Scherping | Validate: Vault readiness step, synthetic cold-cache load, latency < 3ms threshold. Attach summary to doc. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Summary Timeline**\n- **T–15h (Jul 26, 23:00 UTC):** Merge PR, kickoff CI test  \n- **T–8h (Jul 27, 06:00 UTC):** Validate metrics dashboards, pipeline injection  \n- **T–7h:** Send pre-read email  \n- **T–3h:** Finalize deck & do tech check  \n- **T0:** Meeting at 14:00 UTC  \n\n---\n\n### **Risks & Mitigation**\n- **Risk:** Tight window for merging PR & running pipeline overnight.  \n  **Mitigation:** Assign Shakia & Emory as on-call, auto-tag in Teams channel for validation alerts.\n- **Risk:** Alert rule or dashboard failure blocks discussion.  \n  **Mitigation:** Prepare screenshots from prior validated runs as backup slides.\n\n---\n\n### **Action Highlights**\n- All **owners are confirmed attendees**, so alignment feasible.\n- **Key dependency:** PR #472 merge unlocks most downstream prep tasks (metrics validation, deck finalization).\n- **Assumption:** No major pipeline regressions during overnight CI run.\n\n---\n\n✅ **This plan ensures every pre-meeting dependency (code, metrics, docs, agendas) is covered within the 16-hour window.** \n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to also **generate a consolidated pre-read email draft**

Example sources: `FeatureFlagProdRollout_Plan.docx`, `ShardTestStrategy.xlsx`. |\n| **Verify metrics instrumentation & logging hooks in code repositories** | **July 22 (Tue)** | Era | Validate tags for Prometheus exporters reflect cache changes and are aligned with dashboard expectations. |\n| **Security check for JWT cache parameter updates** | **July 22 (Tue)** | Markita | Ensure no leaks, confirm TLS contexts if Redis/memory backing store touched. |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Additional Recommendations\n- Instead of creating an entire new deck, reuse **ShardTestStrategy.xlsx** and metrics snippets if applicable; this accelerates prep.  \n- Use **Teams feature-flag-infra channel** for async sign-offs (as clashing calendars might delay approvals).  \n- If anyone is PTO late in the week, front-load data gathering (risk mitigation).  \n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Summary of Critical Deadlines**\n- **D-6 (July 21):** Materials identified, environment validation kicks off  \n- **D-5/D-4 (July 22–23):** Metrics hooks audited, agenda drafted, initial data aggregated  \n- **D-3/D-2 (July 24–25):** Input collection, dashboard finalization, CI/CD integration verified  \n- **D-1 (July 26):** Pre-read pack shared, dry run completed  \n\n---\n\n✅ **This plan is achievable within 7 days if tasks start tomorrow, but the timeline is tight. Critical path depends on:**\n- Metrics readiness (Markita)\n- CI/CD integration check (Era & Rufina)\n- Pre-read collation (Emory)\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **also draft a quick pre-read outline template** (to include parameter tuning table, Prometheus query samples, pipeline diff) so the team can start filling it in immediately?  \nOr should I **prepare an automated reminder schedule** in

We'll apply similar best practices here.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Step 2: Key Considerations for Timeline**\n- We have **~13 full days** (after today) before meeting.\n- Participants are engineers/DevOps; tasks like metrics validation or pipeline updates may require code readiness before the meeting.\n- Time buffer for **RCAs**, **metrics test snippet collation**, and **Teams content check** is needed.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Step 3: Workback Plan Timeline**\n*(Assumes meeting is 2025-07-27 14:00 UTC; adjust if rescheduled)*\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 1: Preparation (Farther Out)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft meeting agenda outline with major points (cache tuning, metrics, alerts, CI updates) | **Jul 15 (T-12 days)** | Shakia | Use Event description as starting point. Confirm scope with attendees. |\n| Collect recent cache-related metrics & pipeline performance data | **Jul 16 (T-11 days)** | Emory & Era | Pull P95, P99 latency and cache hit/miss ratios from Grafana & Prometheus dashboards. Include any PromQL expressions tested for rollback metrics as reference. |\n| Identify and list impacted components/services for parameter tuning | **Jul 16** | Markita & Rufina | Confirm whether JWT handling services and cluster-level configs require changes. |\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 2: Pre-read Development**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Prepare a **Tech Brief**: *“Dynamic Cache Resizing Insights”* | **Jul 18 (T-9 days)** | Era | Summarize current cache configs, tuning options, and observed constraints; reference prior docs like Grafana_MigrationRollback_Panel_DeepDive for threshold-setting ideas. |\n| Draft **Metrics & Alert Threshold Table** | **Jul 19 (T-8 days)** | Emory | Include target thresholds (e.g., P95 latency, cache eviction rate), PromQL snippets, and group strategy for alerts. |\n| Gather **Pipeline Snippets/Code Blocks** for integration tests & rollback-safe parameter updates | **Jul 19** | Markita | Pull Jenkinsfile and Groovy pattern from migration rollback scripts as example; ensure feature flags or MIGRATION_VERSION-style guards are noted. |\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 3: Finalization & Distribution**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Consolidate agenda + pre-reads into **Meeting Packet (PDF)** | **Jul 21 (T-6 days)** | Shakia | Include tech brief, metrics threshold doc, pipeline update plan. |\n| Upload Packet to **Shared Documents site** & share Teams link | **Jul 22 (T-5 days)** | Shakia | Post in engineering channel; ensure permissions for all attendees. |\n| Confirm attendee availability & add optional reviewers for pre-reads | **Jul 22** | Shakia | Quick Teams ping for confirmations. |\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 4: Dry-Run & Readiness**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Schedule/complete a **quick agenda walkthrough** (10-min sync) | **Jul 24 (T-3 days)** | Emory + Era | Validate metric queries and dashboard screenshots render properly in Teams. |\n| Verify meeting tech/logistics (Teams link, screenshare, panel dashboards open) | **Jul 26 (T-1 day)** | Shakia | Ensure stable connectivity and that sample dashboards open without VPN friction. |\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 5: Day-of Tasks**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Reconfirm meeting flow & speaker sequence | **Jul 27, 10:00 UTC** | Shakia | Kick-off topics: 1) Cache tuning, 2) Metrics, 3) Alerts, 4) CI integration. |\n| Upload any last-minute updated dashboards/snippets in meeting chat | **Jul 27, before session** | Markita / Emory | Prep Teams folder for quick reference during demo. |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Assumptions & Risks**\n- **Assumption:** Meeting objective includes making decisions on cache tuning and alert thresholds; any decisions requiring code changes post-meeting will go to follow-up.\n- **Risk:** Pre-read delays → compresses review time. *Mitigation:* Use shared Teams channel for early drafts daily starting **Jul 15**.\n- **Open Questions:** Need clarification if follow-up actionable tickets should be tracked in Jira; Shakia should confirm during or after session.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 **Summary Table (High-Level Milestones)**\n\n| Date | Milestone |\n|------|-----------|\n| Jul 15 | Agenda draft ready |\n| Jul 18–19 | Pre-read prep: Tech brief, metrics table, Jenkins snippets |\n| Jul 21 | Consolidate & finalize meeting packet |\n| Jul 22 | Share packet + confirm attendance |\n| Jul 24 | Quick dry-run |\n| Jul 26 | Tech check |\n| Jul 27 | Meeting day |\n\n---\n\n✅ **This schedule fits the 2-week window, prioritizes pre-read circulation by mid-window (Jul 21), and mirrors proven patterns from previous engineering workshops in the org’s context.**\n\n---\n\n👉 **Next step:** Shakia (you) should confirm attendee availability and secure quick inputs for the particular cache components in scope.  \nDo you want me to **generate a share-ready timeline in tabular format with color-coding for an Outlook email or Teams post**?

That experience and prior work (e.g., Grafana dashboards, alert rules) are relevant because similar performance validation tasks will likely apply here.\n- No dynamic cache-specific docs were found, so assume new materials must be prepared.  \n  *(Assumption: Adapt methodology from earlier performance workshops based on previous deck/metrics tasks.)*\n\n---\n\n# 📅 **Workback Plan: Dynamic Cache Resizing & Metrics Deep Dive**\n*(Meeting: 2025-07-27 14:00 UTC — all dates in UTC)*\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Preparation (Now → 7 days before meeting)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Draft preliminary **agenda refinement & objectives** | **Jul 15 (Tue)** | Shakia | Confirm final scope; ensure all 5 agenda bullets from invite align with stakeholder goals |\n| Gather **current cache settings & recent performance data** (JWT cache metrics, elasticity parameters) | Jul 16 (Wed) | Markita + Rufina | Pull Grafana/dashboard snapshots, Micrometer histograms, recent load-test reports |\n| Identify and collect **open issues & risk areas** (e.g., config reload behavior, lock contention under resizing) | Jul 16 (Wed) | Era | Summarize known bugs or stress-test anomalies |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Content Development (D-10 to D-6)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Prepare draft **slide deck**:  \n   - Current state metrics  \n   - Proposed resizing algorithm & thresholds  \n   - Alerting strategy | Jul 17 (Thu) | Shakia | Use *TransactionRouter_DeepDive_Details.pptx* style as a template for clarity |\n| Create **draft Grafana dashboard panel updates** for cache metrics (hit/miss ratio, eviction latency, dynamic settings) | Jul 19 (Sat) | Emory | Adapt methods from prior jitter work; add alert rule for >95% utilization sustained |\n| Validate **alert thresholds and integration test coverage** | Jul 19 (Sat) | Rufina | Ensure coverage for failover scenarios; confirm CI Spectral schema updates if needed |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Pre-Read & Dry Run (D-5 to D-1)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Internal **content review & dry run** (15–20 min): Validate metrics screenshots, alerting strategy, integration test slides | Jul 22 (Tue) | All | Focus on accuracy, flow, tech clarity |\n| Finalize **presentation deck & artifacts** | Jul 23 (Wed) | Shakia | Share in EngineeringDocuments/Presentations |\n| Distribute **pre-read materials** and Teams link reminder to attendees | Jul 24 (Thu) | Organizer | Include agenda, deck, updated metrics links |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Final Steps (D-0)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Meeting day: Confirm **Teams link**, recording settings, and backup presenter | Jul 27 (Sun) | Organizer | Prepare Q&A structure |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Additional Notes\n- **Dependencies:**  \n  - Dashboard updates depend on having real metrics extracted by Jul 16.  \n  - Deck finalization depends on dry run feedback (Jul 22).  \n- **Risk Mitigation:** Add buffer for metrics collection; target earlier completion of dashboards (Jul 19) to allow troubleshooting if needed.\n- **Assumptions:**  \n  - No additional stakeholders or scope beyond what’s in the invite.  \n  - Performance environments and monitoring stack (Grafana, Micrometer) available and stable.  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Action for You (Emory)**\n- Coordinate with Rufina to pull baseline cache metrics by **Jul 16**.  \n- Begin drafting Grafana dashboard mock-ups by **Jul 19**.  \n\n---\n\n✅ Do you want me to **generate a Teams task list with these milestones for you and other attendees**, or **auto-create a structured doc (Word/OneNote) and store it in EngineeringDocuments/Presentations**?  \n*(I can also pre-fill a slide template using the older TransactionRouter deep dive style.)*", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null,

Considerations Before Workback\n- Meeting goal: **Analyze canary results, discuss performance and error anomalies, and agree on next steps for production rollout.**\n- Attendees span Engineering, QA, DevOps → need consolidated input on:\n    - Canary run metrics (latency, error rates, log anomalies).\n    - Known rollback or incident tickets.\n- Recent context: Secure Sprint, HMAC pipeline enhancements, and telemetry schema updates → these likely influenced canary stability; summaries helpful.\n- Plan needs to **finalize agenda, gather metrics, draft summary deck, and circulate to participants before 07/24 EOD**.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Workback Plan (Starting from 2025-07-25 Meeting)\n\n### **Phase 3: Day of Meeting – 2025-07-25**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Host Post-Canary Retrospective | **07/25 08:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Check Teams link; confirm screen sharing permissions; allow 5-10min early join for AV check. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Finalization – 2025-07-24**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Circulate final agenda & pre-read deck | **07/24 17:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Attach final metrics summary + action item list; share via Teams/Email. |\n| Validate Teams link & attendee confirmations | **07/24 16:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Confirm Cortez, Rufina, Myles availability; update if conflicts arise. |\n| Internal dry run (optional but ideal) | **07/24 15:00 UTC** | Keren (with optional QA lead) | 15-min check to ensure key charts and rollback flows are clear. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Prep & Inputs – 2025-07-22 to 2025-07-23**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Draft meeting agenda** | **07/22 20:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Topics: 1) Error spikes post-canary, 2) Latency & KPIs vs targets, 3) Lessons for rollout, 4) Action items. |\n| **Collect canary performance metrics & logs** | **07/23 12:00 UTC** | Cortez Dehn | Include Prometheus latency/error rates, rollback snapshots. |\n| **QA defect & rollback summary** | **07/23 12:00 UTC** | Myles Mckoan | Ensure Jira issue IDs & status grouped by severity. |\n| **Draft summary slides (metrics + recommendations)** | **07/23 18:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Use structure seen in prior retros (see *Fraud_Anomaly_Algorithm_Optimizations* for style reference). |\n| **Send early heads-up to attendees with preliminary stats** | **07/23 19:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Short note in Teams: “Here’s what we’ll cover; final deck tomorrow.” |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Assumptions & Risks\n- **Canary logs + Perf KPIs** are accessible by Engineering (Cortez) and QA (Myles).\n- No pre-read attached to event → assuming we need to create one.\n- Only 2 working days before meeting → plan is aggressive, owners must prioritize tasks.\n- If last-minute errors occur in data pull, escalate in Teams for real-time fixes.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Quick Visual Timeline\n```\n07/22 EOD → Agenda drafted\n07/23 midday → Metrics (DevOps & QA)\n07/23 evening → First draft deck\n07/24 EOD → Final deck & agenda sent\n07/25 AM UTC → Meeting\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 🔍 Why These Steps?\n- Agenda first: ensures alignment before metrics collection.\n- Early preliminary heads-up: keeps attendees engaged and ready.\n- Final pre-read by 24th: critical so stakeholders review overnight for early UTC call.\n\n---\n\n**Do you want me to:**\n✅ Draft the **agenda content** now  \n✅ Create an **outline for the retrospective deck** based on prior templates  \n✅ Prepare a **Teams message/email snippet** to send with pre-reads  \n\n*(Pick any or all — I can build them fast.)*", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should

Essential for guiding pre-read content. |\n| Collect canary deployment outcome logs and error spike dashboards | **2025-07-19 EOD** | Cortez Dehn | Pull logs from CI/CD and monitoring dashboards (reference Chaos Context as needed). |\n| Gather performance metrics vs. baseline (P95 latency, error rates during canary) | **2025-07-20** | Rufina Ganie | Ensure metrics align with thresholds established in previous pipelines. |\n| Validate QA results from canary stage | **2025-07-20** | Myles Mckoan | Confirm all regression and performance test summary reports are available. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Draft Material & Review**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft retrospective discussion deck (agenda bullets + charts) | **2025-07-21** | Keren Guisbert | Include error spike timelines, pipeline gating impact, and production-readiness scorecard. |\n| Internal review of deck & action proposal | **2025-07-22** | All core attendees | Review asynchronously via Teams or Confluence link. Comments closed by EOD. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Finalization & Pre-Read Distribution**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Incorporate feedback and publish final deck | **2025-07-23 AM** | Keren Guisbert | Upload to Teams folder and link in meeting invite. |\n| Send pre-read email (deck + metrics link) | **2025-07-23 EOD** | Keren Guisbert | Emphasize focus areas: rollback criteria, alert threshold tuning, and DevOps automation steps. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Meeting Readiness**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Dry run (15 mins) to validate flow and tech setup | **2025-07-24** | Keren Guisbert & Cortez Dehn | Ensure Teams screen-share works, relevant dashboards accessible. |\n| Final confirmation of attendance | **2025-07-24** | Keren Guisbert | Ping attendees; adjust agenda if constraints arise. |\n\n---\n\n### **Meeting Day**\n| Task | Time | Owner | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Start meeting on Teams link | **2025-07-25 08:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Keep session focused to 30 mins; record action items in real-time. |\n\n---\n\n## 🚩 Risks & Mitigation\n- **Tight Timeline:** Only ~5 business days before meeting. → Mitigation: Parallelize preparation tasks, use async review.  \n- **Dependent Data:** Canary logs and QA metrics must be available by July 20 to avoid bottlenecks. Follow up aggressively.  \n- **No Pre-read Attached:** Build deck from scratch using standard retrospective template.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n\n✅ **Generate an editable timeline table in Excel**  \n✅ **Draft the pre-read agenda email template**  \n✅ **Create a risk/owners tracker in Confluence style**  \n\n---  \n\n**Next Step Recommendation:** Confirm agenda today (July 19 deadline)

enterprise data and timelines:\n\n---\n\n# ✅ Workback Plan: **Post-Canary Pipeline Retrospective**\n**Meeting Details**  \n- **Subject:** Post-Canary Pipeline Retrospective  \n- **Date/Time:** Friday, **July 25, 2025, 08:00–08:30 UTC**  \n- **Organizer:** Keren Guisbert  \n- **Required Attendees:** Cortez Dehn (you), Keren Guisbert, Rufina Ganie, Myles Mckoan  \n- **Location:** Microsoft Teams Meeting  \n- **Objective:** Review canary deployment outcomes, analyze error spikes, assess performance metrics, and plan action items before production roll-out.  \n\n**Current Time:** July 18, 2025, 16:00 (UTC+8) → ~6 full days remain.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠ Assumptions & Constraints:\n- Canary deployment data and metrics are already collected in CI/CD logs.\n- Many supporting details (e.g., FeatureFlagInfra outcomes, security gating) exist in **`FeatureFlagInfra_Outcomes_Presentation.pdf`** and **`FeatureFlagInfra_PipelineMetrics.xlsx`**—both created July 17.\n- QA input needed from Myles; pipeline fix context from Cortez; deployment orchestration detail from Keren.\n- Timeline is tight (6 days), so tasks will run in **parallel** where possible.\n\n---\n\n## 📆 Workback Timeline\n\n### **Phase 1: Prep Analysis & Data Compilation**  \n| Task | Due Date (UTC) | Owner | Notes / Dependencies |\n|------|---------------|-------|----------------------|\n| Consolidate Canary Run Metrics (error rates, latency, success %) | **Jul 19 EOD** | Myles Mckoan | Pull from Prometheus, Jenkins logs; cross-check against FeatureFlagInfra_PipelineMetrics.xlsx |\n| Extract Feature Flag Behavior Insights (incorrect defaults, flagged errors) | **Jul 19 EOD** | Keren Guisbert | Refer to slides in FeatureFlagInfra_Outcomes_Presentation.pdf |\n| Validate Security Gate Enforcement & Failure Threshold in Jenkinsfile | **Jul 20** | Cortez Dehn | Pipeline-shared@v1.2.0 context in Security Assessment Deep Dive.docx |\n| Summarize Key Failures & Root Causes in Draft Report | **Jul 20** | Cortez Dehn + Myles | Use Deep Dive.docx for reference |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Agenda & Pre-Read Development**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft Preliminary Agenda | **Jul 21 AM** | Keren | Sections: Metrics review, Root Cause Analysis, Action Planning |\n| Circulate Agenda to Attendees for Input | **Jul 21 PM** | Keren | Collect suggestions via Teams thread |\n| Prepare Pre-Read Packet (merged PDF w/ metrics chart + FeatureFlagInfra highlights) | **Jul 22** | Cortez + Keren | Include summarized findings, key charts from both July 17 docs |\n| Upload Pre-Read to EngineeringDocuments & Share Link | **Jul 22 EOD** | Cortez | Tag attendees for acknowledgment |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Action Item Drafting & Meeting Readiness**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm Tech Setup (Teams link, screen share permissions) | **Jul 23** | Keren | Verify meeting invite link is accessible and updated if needed |\n| Prepare Discussion Deck w/ Recommendations | **Jul 23 EOD** | Cortez | Summarize canary results, next steps for production roll-out |\n| Collect Attendee Feedback on Pre-Read | **Jul 24 noon** | All | Ensure alignment before meeting |\n| Finalize Action Item Templates in Confluence | **Jul 24 EOD** | Myles | Use consistent formatting for sprint follow‑up |\n\n---\n\n### **Meeting Day: Jul 25**  \n- Start 08:00 UTC sharp, ensure recording enabled, assign live note-taker.  \n- Post meeting: Distribute summary + JIRA tickets within 4 hrs. *(Assign post-meeting owner during session)*  \n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Assets:\n- `FeatureFlagInfra_Outcomes_Presentation.pdf` – outcomes, pipeline enhancements  \n- `FeatureFlagInfra_PipelineMetrics.xlsx` – detailed timing & success/failure logs  \n- `Security Assessment Deep Dive.docx` – gating controls, Vault integration  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ Key Risks & Mitigations:\n- **Risk:** Pre-read not reviewed in time → *Schedule a 15-min sync Jul 24 if silence persists.*  \n- **Risk:** Data gaps (metric anomalies) → *Flag discrepancies Jul 19 to allow extra day for pull/validation.*  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n✔ Generate this plan as a **shared Teams Planner board** with color‑coded phases?  \nOR  \n✔ Export as a **structured timeline in Excel** for upload to `EngineeringDocuments`?  \n\n*(I can do both if that helps.)*", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should state the meeting [SUBJECT],

Sections: Metrics deep dive, Error spike RCA, Jenkins/Prometheus config adjustments, Next steps. |\n| Identify key supporting materials | **July 15** | Cortez Dehn | Define what artifacts to include: Canary pipeline logs, Prometheus latency/error dashboards, Grafana trend exports, Jira tickets on canary anomalies. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Data & Content Preparation**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Collect canary deployment metrics & error spike data | **July 17** | Rufina Ganie | Gather CPU, P95 latency, error rate anomalies & correlate with deployment window. Ensure full coverage for rollback phases. |\n| Validate monitoring alerts & pipeline configs | **July 18** | Cortez Dehn | Confirm Jenkins Canary stage logs, Prometheus alert thresholds, runbook alignment. |\n| QA Review: Validate pre/post-canary performance | **July 18** | Myles Mckoan | Pull QA validation data and flag regressions versus baseline builds. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Agenda & Pre-read Finalization**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Finalize agenda and discussion flow | **July 19** | Keren Guisbert | Include sections: (1) Summary metrics review; (2) Error spike deep dive; (3) Decisions for production rollout. |\n| Prepare “Retrospective Deck” (or doc) | **July 21** | Cortez Dehn + Rufina Ganie | Structure similar to prior “PaymentsAPI_Retro_Deck” format: Context, Metrics, Issues, Action Items. |\n| Upload deck + supporting files to Teams invite | **July 22** | Keren Guisbert | Ensure all attendees have access; link in meeting invite. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Pre-Meeting Readiness**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Send pre-read & final agenda to attendees | **July 23** | Keren Guisbert | Highlight decisions needed. Request attendees review data and come prepared with suggestions for thresholds, rollback strategy, next-phase automation. |\n| Confirm Teams link, audio/video checks | **July 24** | Keren Guisbert | Validate virtual setup. Add fallback link if needed. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Meeting Day**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Host retrospective session | **July 25 @ 08:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Stick to 30-min slot; use timer on sections; capture action items in real time (e.g., Jira or Planner). |\n| Assign follow-up actions live | During meeting | All participants | Push immediate owners into the pipeline updates track. |\n\n---\n\n### **Post-Meeting Quick Follow-Ups**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Distribute meeting notes and decisions | **July 25 (EOD)** | Keren Guisbert | Summarize key findings, next steps, and link to relevant Jira tickets. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Dependencies & Risk Notes\n- **Dependencies:**  \n  - Accurate metrics from monitoring stack before July 18  \n  - QA validation complete before agenda finalization  \n- **Risks & Mitigations:**  \n  - Tight turnaround if canary metrics delayed → Mitigate by starting data pull ASAP  \n  - Confusion on roles → This plan assumes Cortez handles DevOps aspects, Rufina handles app metrics, Myles handles QA validation. Adjust if roles differ.\n\n---\n\n### **Assumptions & Uncertainties**\n- Meeting details (date/time/attendees) come from the confirmed event entity. ✅  \n- No explicit retrospective deck attached yet → modeled tasks on prior retrospective patterns for similar sessions.\n- Owners aligned to job roles from directory data.\n\n---\n\n#### 🔗 Suggested File References for Prep:\n- Use **prior retrospective format** like: `PaymentsAPI_Retro_Deck.pdf` for structure.\n- Bring context from `PaymentsAPI_Chaos_DeepMetrics.xlsx` only as a reference for **data presentation best practices**, not content (topic differs).\n\n---\n\n✅ **This plan reflects a focused two-week prep window aligned to your actual meeting date (July 25, 2025) and role responsibilities.**\n\n---\n\n**Do you want me to:**  \n✔ Create this timeline as a **shareable visual (Gantt-style) for Teams/Confluence**, or  \n✔ Generate a **Teams task list with ownership and due dates for quick assignment**?", "assertions":

Some tasks will need to run **in parallel**.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Workback Plan for “Canary Pipeline Debrief & Metrics Analysis”  \n*(Working backward from July 25, 08:00 UTC)*\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Pre-Meeting Tasks**\n**Thursday, July 24 (UTC)**  \n| Task | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| **Finalize Deck & Talking Points** | Keren Guisbert | Aggregate pipeline KPIs (success %, error counts, latency trends). Pull from **internal monitoring / Jenkins logs** as per prior chaos & DevSecOps pattern. |\n| **Test Teams Meeting Link & Screen Share** | Cortez Dehn | Validate environment connectivity; ensure metrics dashboards render in call. |\n| **Send Pre-Read Reminder** | Keren Guisbert | Include deck link + key agenda points. Deadline: **16:00 UTC** (EOD Eastern). |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Consolidation & Review**\n**Wednesday, July 23 (UTC)**  \n| Task | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| **Pull Latest Canary Run Metrics** | Cortez Dehn | Capture: Deployment success rate, error counts, rollback triggers, P95 latency under canary load. |\n| **QA Validation Summary** | Myles Mckoan | Confirm **post-canary verification steps passed**; flag any anomalies impacting production readiness. |\n| **Draft Agenda & Slide Outline** | Keren Guisbert | Sections: <br>1️⃣ Run outcome summary <br>2️⃣ Error profiles <br>3️⃣ Performance KPIs <br>4️⃣ Promotion decision criteria. |\n| **Dependency Check** | Rufina Ganie | Verify service configuration parity between canary and staging; note any schema changes relevant for decision. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Immediate Actions (Now–End of Day July 22)**  \n| Task | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| **Confirm Access to Canary Dashboards & Logs** | Cortez Dehn | Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana links validated for historical queries. |\n| **Identify Agenda Gaps & Risks** | Keren Guisbert | Focus on canary → production readiness blockers. Confirm error budget consumption and error rates align with SLOs. |\n| **Stakeholder Alignment Check** | All | Quick Teams chat in #devops-pipeline to ensure attendees aware of deliverables. |\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Key Dependencies & Risks\n- **Metrics Availability:** Ensure canary logs are queryable before July 23; escalate to DevOps if permissions block export.\n- **Compressed Schedule:** No weekend buffer → tasks must close by July 24 EOD UTC.\n- **Cross-Team Sign-Off:** QA and DevOps inputs critical to shape action items; delays here cascade into agenda prep.\n\n---\n\n### **Assumptions**\n- Meeting objective is as stated: *outcome analysis + next-step planning prior to production*\n- No additional stakeholders expected; if Leadership requires visibility, deck might need polish.\n- Using Teams link from event (verified in grounding).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Quick Checklist Before Go-Live:\n- [ ] Agenda locked (July 23)\n- [ ] Metrics & QA validation complete (July 23)\n- [ ] Slides & speaking order confirmed (July 24)\n- [ ] Tech dry run (July 24)\n- [ ] Reminders sent (July 24)\n\n---\n\n👉 **Do you want me to also prepare a concise pre-read slide outline for this

Debrief & Metrics Analysis\"**, based strictly on the provided enterprise data.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Meeting Details (from grounding data)\n- **Subject:** Canary Pipeline Debrief & Metrics Analysis  \n- **Date & Time:** **Friday, July 25, 2025 – 08:00–08:30 UTC**  \n- **Organizer:** Keren Guisbert (lod_kerenguisbert)  \n- **Attendees:** Cortez Dehn *(you)*, Keren G., Rufina G., Myles M.  \n- **Objective (from event body):**  \n  > Review outcome of the canary pipeline run, analyze deployment success rates, error counts, performance metrics, and plan next steps before promotion to production.  \n- **Location:** Teams Meeting Link  \n- **Current time:** 2025-07-18T16:00:00 +08:00 (≈7 days before meeting)  \n- **Related artifacts:**  \n  - *FeatureFlagInfra_Outcomes_Presentation.pdf* (pipeline bake, canary test outcomes)  \n  - *FeatureFlagInfra_PipelineMetrics.xlsx* (stage-level timings and success data)  \n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Context Observations   \n- Tight timeline: **7 calendar days**, 5 working days if assuming no weekend work.  \n- Related files show metrics and outcomes from previous pipeline work—should serve as pre-reads.  \n- Attendees are engineering and QA roles → expect technical discussion on metrics and quality gates.  \n- Objective implies **data consolidation**, **agenda alignment**, and **pre-read distribution** are critical.  \n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Plan (Anchored to July 25, 08:00 UTC)  \n\n### **Phase 1 – Final Prep (Meeting Week)**\n| #  | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|----|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 1 | **Validate call logistics** (Teams link, time zones) | **July 23 (Wed)** | Keren (Organizer) | Ensure no conflicts and attendees have link. |\n| 2 | **Dry-run review of metrics deck** | **July 24 (Thu), 12:00 UTC** | Cortez | Use *FeatureFlagInfra_Outcomes_Presentation.pdf* and pipeline metrics sheet; confirm all charts are up-to-date. |\n| 3 | **Send final reminder with agenda & pre-read links** | **July 24 (Thu), EOD** | Keren | Attach deck link + spreadsheet from shared location. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2 – Core Content Finalization**\n| #  | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|----|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 4 | **Draft agenda (include discussion time for next steps)** | **July 21 (Mon)** | Keren + Cortez | Topics: success rate summary, error log analysis, gating thresholds. |\n| 5 | **Ingest latest canary run results** | **July 22 (Tue), noon UTC** | Cortez | Pull metrics from pipeline dashboards; update Excel file. |\n| 6 | **Update & freeze metrics deck** (*FeatureFlagInfra_Outcomes_Presentation.pdf*) | **July 22 (Tue), EOD** | Cortez | Ensure charts reflect final data; incorporate any delta from last runs. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3 – Early Prep & Inputs Collection**\n| #  | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|----|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 7 | **Confirm attendee availability & roles (QA vs Eng)** | **July 19 (Sat)** | Keren | If conflicts arise, escalate for backup rep for QA or DevOps. |\n| 8 | **Identify open issues / high-risk anomalies in Canary** | **July 20 (Sun)** | Rufina & Myles | Flag any threshold breaches, error counts so pre-discussion data is visible. |\n| 9 | **Collect feedback from stakeholders on focus metrics** | **July 20 (Sun)** | Keren | Ping team on Slack/Teams channels for any extra agenda items. |\n\n---\n\n## 🗒 Notes / Assumptions\n- **Time zone check:** Meeting is in UTC; confirm local times for attendees.  \n- **Artifacts already exist** (PDF + XLSX) → no need to generate new templates.  \n- Owners inferred from roles:  \n  - *Cortez (you)* = DevOps metrics + deck update  \n  - *Keren* = Organizer + agenda/logistics  \n  - *Rufina & Myles* = QA/engineering anomaly validation  \n- Using buffer: key content frozen by **EOD July 22**, allows 2 days for distribution and last-minute fixes.  \n- Weekends included for availability check only; real work targeted on weekdays.  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ Summary Timeline\n- **T-6 days:** Confirm attendees & collect metric focus inputs (July 19–20)  \n- **T-4 days:** Agenda finalized; metrics refreshed (July 21–22)  \n- **T-1 day:** Pre-read & reminder sent; deck dry run (July 24)  \n- **Day 0:** Meeting at 08:00 UTC on July 25  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to **auto-generate a consolidated pre-read packet link** (combining *PipelineMetrics.xlsx* and *Outcomes_Presentation.pdf*) and add **a timeline view (Gantt-like) for clarity**?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "",

If deeper canary logs or dashboards exist, they should be incorporated in the “Collect pipeline metrics” task.\n\n- **Current time:** July 11, 2025, 16:00 +08:00 (≈ 13.5 days before meeting).\n\n---\n\n## 🗂 Workback Plan: *Canary Pipeline Debrief & Metrics Analysis*\n*(Meeting is on **Fri, July 25 at 08:00 UTC**. Timeline works backward.)*\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Immediate Actions (T-minus 13–12 days)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm pipeline run scope and success criteria | **July 12** | Keren Guisbert | Enumerate what stats to review: success rates, error counts, latency, rollback info. Pull this from canary CI/CD job runs (Jenkins/Argo logs). |\n| Collect raw metrics and logs from canary environment | **July 13** | Cortez Dehn (DevOps) | Include deployment logs, alert history, rollback/retry attempts. Ensure accuracy before analysis. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Data Analysis & Initial Plan Draft (T-minus 11–8 days)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Aggregate metrics into a concise report/dashboard | **July 15** | Rufina Ganie (Engineering) | Summarize pipeline metrics, error distributions, and promotion blockers. Use shared dashboard or PDF. |\n| Draft preliminary findings & risks for review | **July 16** | Keren Guisbert | Highlight key points: success % vs SLA, key bottlenecks. Include recommendation outline for QA sign-off. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Review & Materials Finalization (T-minus 7–4 days)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| QA validation of error counts and rollback actions | **July 18** | Myles Mckoan | Ensure bug counts and rollback triggers are accurate before entering meeting deck. |\n| Prepare and format pre-read summary deck (optional) | **July 19** | Keren Guisbert | Include 3–5 slides: Objectives, metrics snapshot, error trend graphs, proposed next steps. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Distribution & Dry Run (T-minus 3–1 day)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Circulate agenda and final materials to attendees | **July 22** | Keren Guisbert | Send Teams invite update or email with pre-read link in Files/Teams channel. Add meeting link explicitly. |\n| **(Optional)** Quick sync/dry run on metric interpretations | **July 23** | Cortez + Rufina + Keren | 15-min call: align on key talking points, ensure no surprises during meeting. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Final Prep (Meeting Day)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Validate Teams link & screen-sharing | **July 24** | Keren | Open meeting early to test. Ensure dashboards accessible if live demo planned. |\n| **Meeting: Canary Pipeline Debrief & Metrics Analysis** | **July 25, 08:00 UTC** | All | Goal: confirm readiness for prod promotion; finalize action items and owners. |\n\n---\n\n### 🛠 Assumptions & Risks\n- **Assumption:** No external vendor deliverables; all data internal (Jenkins, monitoring dashboards).\n- **Risk if delayed:** Cortez or Rufina not delivering metrics on time will compress QA and deck prep window. Mitigate by timeboxing collection and early ping by July 13.\n- **Next steps after meeting:** Likely a follow-up for promotion/go-live approval; add to backlog.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Quick Tips for Execution\n- Use **Teams chat thread** for rolling updates.\n- Store the draft and final decks in `/Engineering/Pipeline-Reviews` for traceability.\n- Tag attendees 24h before meeting to confirm attendance.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-copy visual timeline (Gantt-style) or a Teams-ready checklist with reminders**?

15:00–15:45 UTC**  \n**Mode:** Microsoft Teams Meeting *(link in event details)*  \n**Attachments:**  \n- [**AuthPerf_Detailed_Metrics.xlsx**](files\\\\AuthPerf_Detailed_Metrics.xlsx) *(Meeting invite attachment – performance data relevant to patch review)*  \n- Meeting body mentions **REQ-1423 requirements spec** *(assumed located in requirements directory or Confluence – verify and attach pre-read link before distribution)*  \n\n**Current Time (from user context):** 2025-07-22T23:00:00+08:00 → UTC: **2025-07-22 15:00**  \n**Time until meeting:** ~2.5 days (tight timeline — tasks must be compressed).\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Assumptions & Notes\n- Meeting date/time is confirmed from calendar event (July 25, 15:00 UTC).\n- REQ-1423 spec location not provided; include a step to fetch and attach.\n- Sau is the meeting organizer and will coordinate prep tasks; Markita owns DevOps-related validation; Era optional (loop in if tooling discussion needed).\n- No dry run deemed necessary (short, focused 1:1), but confirm technical access and screen-sharing readiness.\n- Aggressive timeline: **Milestones set within next ~60 hours**.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Timeline (Starting from Meeting Date)\n| # | Task | Due Date (UTC) | Owner | Notes |\n|---|------|---------------|-------|-------|\n| **MEETING DAY: Jul 25 (Fri)** |\n| 1 | **Final Access & Tech Check (Teams link, screen-share, flamegraph CI pipeline ready)** | Jul 25 14:30 (30 min before) | Sau | Confirm meeting link works, test flamegraph pipeline view if needed |\n| 2 | **Distribute Join Reminder with Final Pack (links + attachments)** | Jul 25 13:00 | Sau | Include: Teams link, REQ-1423 spec, AuthPerf_Detailed_Metrics.xlsx, any flamegraph screenshots |\n| **T-1 Day: Jul 24 (Thu)** |\n| 3 | **Finalize Discussion Agenda & Questions** | Jul 24 18:00 | Sau | Cover: Self-extracting JAR internals, JMH JSONOutputFormat integration, risk of dynamic –Xmx, flamegraph CI insights |\n| 4 | **Validate Inputs Prepared (Metrics + Spec)** | Jul 24 18:00 | Markita | Ensure AuthPerf metrics reviewed; REQ-1423 fetched and confirmed |\n| 5 | **Review Risk Mitigation Notes for XMX Patch** | Jul 24 20:00 | Sau | Summarize in prep doc; consider rollback mitigation strategies |\n| **T-2 Days: Jul 23 (Wed)** |\n| 6 | **Gather Performance Metrics from Current CI Runs** | Jul 23 21:00 | Markita | Pull fresh JMH/flamegraph data if available; confirm in AuthPerf_Detailed_Metrics.xlsx |\n| 7 | **Check Related Docs in Repo (REQ-1423)** | Jul 23 20:00 | Sau | Locate spec in repo or Confluence; upload to shared folder |\n| 8 | **Draft Agenda Skeleton + Key Discussion Points** | Jul 23 20:00 | Sau | Early outline for internal review |\n| **T-2.5 Days: Jul 22 (Tue, current day)** |\n| 9 | **Send Heads-Up & Request Preliminary Questions from Markita** | Jul 22 23:59 | Sau | Quick Teams ping with context: will review patch internals & perf metrics |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Key Dependencies\n- **Task 6 depends on Task 8?** No, independent: metrics retrieval and agenda prep can proceed in parallel.\n- **Task 4 depends on Task 7 completion** (REQ-1423 available).\n- Invitation already sent; no time to expand participant list unless critical.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Critical Links from Context\n- Meeting invite: *Teams join URL in event details*\n- Attachment: **AuthPerf_Detailed_Metrics.xlsx** *(linked in event)*\n- Locate **REQ-1423** reference before Jul 23 to include in prep pack.\n- Performance context related to flamegraph CI pipeline and JMH output (mentioned in invite).\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Suggested Distribution Plan\n- **Meeting Prep Pack** (Jul 25, 13:00):  \n    - MS Teams link  \n    - REQ-1423 requirements spec  \n    - **AuthPerf_Detailed_Metrics.xlsx**  \n    - Agenda (PDF or inline email)  \n\n---\n\n## Summary Table by Phase\n\n**Phase 1 – Information Gathering**  \nJul 22 evening – Jul 23: Fetch spec, pull metrics, draft agenda skeleton\n\n**Phase 2 – Agenda & Pre-Read Finalization**  \nJul 24 by EOD: Lock agenda, verify inputs complete, outline risk questions\n\n**Phase 3 – Communication & Tech Readiness**  \nJul 25 pre-meeting: Final pack, reminders, link validation\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Risks & Mitigations\n- **Tight timeline (2.5 days)** → Compress tasks and confirm via Teams chat daily.\n- **Spec location unknown** → Prioritize Task 7; escalate if not found by Jul 23 noon.\n- **Optional attendee (Era)** unclear → Re-confirm participation by Jul 24.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Next Immediate Step:**  \n→ Sau to **locate REQ-1423 spec and draft preliminary agenda** tonight, then ping Markita for metric updates.\n\n---", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should include a backward timeline from T₀ with

Focus on critical milestones:\n- Agenda clarity & alignment on objectives.\n- Distribution of pre-reads and recent docs.\n- Ensure test scenarios, artifacts, and meeting logistics are finalized.\n- Short sync or async review for last-minute clarifications.\n\n---\n\n## **Workback Plan (Working Back from 2025-07-25, 10:00 AM PDT)**\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Pre-Meeting Touchpoints**\n| Task | Due Date & Time | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----------------|-------|-------|\n| **Meeting Room & Link Verification** | **Jul 25, 09:15 AM PDT** | Keren | Confirm Teams link works; test audio/video; ensure screen-sharing permitted. |\n| **Load Key Docs for Screen Share** | **Jul 25, 09:15 AM PDT** | Keren | Prepare: `Integration_Test_Session_Outcomes.pptx`, `UI_Integration_Test_Flow_Diagram.pdf`. Validate access via SharePoint. |\n| **Pre-Meeting Quick Sync with Shari (if possible)** | **Jul 25, 09:00 AM PDT** | Keren & Shari | Optional 10-min check to align on discussion points & priority topics. If not possible, send Slack/Teams recap of key objectives. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Day-of Prep (Morning Window)**  \n| Task | Due Date & Time | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----------------|-------|-------|\n| **Upload Final Docs/Links to Meeting Chat** | **Jul 25, 08:30 AM PDT** | Keren | Drop links for: PPT deck, UI flow diagram, test spec references. |\n| **Send Reminder + Pre-Read Ping** | **Jul 25, 08:00 AM PDT** | Keren | Short Teams message: recap objectives + attach `Integration_Test_Session_Outcomes` deck. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Night-Before Critical Tasks (Limited Window)**  \n*(Current time: Jul 24 evening local; assume Keren can work tonight)*  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|-------|\n| **Review Latest Integration Artifacts** | **Jul 24, 10:00 PM PDT** (~in next hours) | Keren | Skim `Integration_Test_Session_Outcomes.pptx` for retry logic, auth stubbing coverage. Ensure consistency with expected test cases. |\n| **Outline Meeting Agenda (Concise)** | **Jul 24, 09:30 PM PDT** | Keren | 3 bullets max: (1) Cypress stubbing & auth flow enhancements, (2) Test result insights (timeouts/analytics), (3) CI pipeline integration steps. |\n| **Email/Teams Pre-Read Note to Shari** | **Jul 24, 09:45 PM PDT** | Keren | Include agenda bullets + link to docs. Use SharePoint links → avoid local file only. |\n\n---\n\n## **Critical Deliverables**\n- **Agenda:** Confirmed & communicated by end of today.\n- **Docs Accessible:** PPT and PDFs verified in shared location.\n- **Meeting logistics validated:** Teams link, content sharing tested.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Dependencies / Risks**\n- **Time is extremely tight** (≈15 hrs). Missing tonight’s actions compromises pre-read review.\n- Ensure SharePoint permissions for `Integration_Test_Session_Outcomes.pptx` & `UI_Integration_Test_Flow_Diagram.pdf` (already shared with you, Shari per metadata).\n- If Shari cannot review pre-reads, allocate 3–5 min at start for quick context briefing.\n- No additional attendees currently visible; if others must join, **send invite ASAP**.\n\n---\n\n### **Assumptions**\n- Meeting date/time confirmed per Event `Cypress Test Deep Dive` (Jul 25, 10:00 PDT).\n- Purpose = Cypress E2E/auth flow deep dive based on artifact titles and recent chat/email threads.\n- Only one attendee listed; plan assumes a focused, tactical session.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Next Immediate Action for You (Keren):**\n1. Draft and send **brief agenda + SharePoint links for UI_Integration_Test_Flow_Diagram & Integration_Test_Session_Outcomes** to Shari TONIGHT.\n2. Test Teams link and ensure decks open smoothly.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate the actual pre-read message (Teams/Email draft)** for you, including links to the relevant files and a 3-bullet agenda, so you can just copy-paste and send?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should include a backward timeline from T₀ with

Thus, key steps like agenda and pre-read creation will require immediate attention.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 **Workback Timeline for “Cypress Test Deep Dive”**\n*(Meeting Day = July 25, 2025, 10:00 PDT)*\n\n---\n\n### **Finalization Phase (Meeting Day & Eve)**\n| Task | Due Date (PDT) | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------------|-------|-------|\n| Join the “Cypress Test Deep Dive” meeting | **July 25, 10:00 AM** | All Attendees | Confirm Teams link via calendar invite |\n| Final pre-meeting tech check (audio/video, shared screen) | **July 25, 09:30 AM** | Shari | Ensure test project repo access and any demo scripts ready |\n| Send quick reminder to all participants (optional) | **July 24, 5:00 PM** | Keren (Organizer) | Courtesy reminder |\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation Phase (July 22–24)**\n\n#### **1. Agenda & Objective Alignment**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft a concise agenda for “Cypress Test Deep Dive” | **July 23, 10:00 AM** | Shari *(assumed, as attendee driving prep)* | Include: test coverage goals, parallel execution, flaky test mitigation, CI/CD integration |\n| Send agenda to Keren Guisbert for review & approval | **July 23, 1:00 PM** | Shari | Ensure objectives align with Keren’s expectations |\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Pre-Read and Supporting Material**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Prepare or gather Cypress testing reference materials | **July 23, EOD** | Shari | Could reuse insights from previous “CI/CD Fine-Tuning” sessions (e.g., pipeline changes, error thresholds) |\n| Share final agenda + pre-read with attendees | **July 24, 10:00 AM** | Shari | Distribute early for context |\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Technical Environment Setup**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Verify access to test repo and relevant environments | **July 24, noon** | Shari | Ensure ability to demo commands or show logs |\n| Optional dry run of any planned Cypress flows/demo | **July 24, 3:00 PM** | Shari | Validate demo stability to prevent meeting delays |\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ **Assumptions & Risks**\n- **Assumption**: Meeting topic focuses on Cypress e2e automation strategy and possibly integration with existing CI/CD setups (based on context).\n- **No linked artifacts**: No agenda or files provided → agenda and materials must be created from scratch.\n- **Very short timeline**: Only ~2.5 days left → tasks are front-loaded and aggressive. If owners cannot confirm tasks by July 23 morning, meeting might lack clarity.\n- **Roles**: Keren is organizer; Shari is attendee. Defaulted many prep tasks to Shari since you initiated the request.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Summary Checklist**\n- [ ] Agenda drafted & approved by **July 23**  \n- [ ] Pre-read finalized & shared by **July 24 morning**  \n- [ ] Repo/demo environment ready & optional dry run by **July 24 afternoon**  \n- [ ] Tech check & join meeting by **July 25 morning**  \n\n---\n\n👉 **Next Step for You:**  \nStart immediately with agenda drafting — **due Wednesday morning (July 23)** so review can happen same day.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-use agenda template (with sections aligned to Cypress Deep Dive)** and a **pre-read template for quick distribution**?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should state the meeting [SUBJECT],

updates (per July 14 chat), PCI fields related to encryptionType.|\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2 – Draft Agenda & Pre-Read Development (T–5 to T–3 days)**  \n**Deadline: July 21 (Monday)**  \n| Task | Owner | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n|Draft agenda for “Cypress Test Deep Dive”| Keren Guisbert | Suggested items: 1) Review current Cypress test suite; 2) Test coverage for HMAC & schema; 3) Gaps & next steps.|\n|Compile supporting material for discussion| Keren Guisbert | Pull content from: `Mid_Sprint_Design_Review_Deck.pdf` (UI/schema), HMAC validation document, and relevant pipeline snippets. |\n|Check attendee availability| Keren Guisbert | Only Shari Jatho confirmed; verify if QA or DevSecOps input needed.|\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3 – Materials Finalization & Meeting Logistics (T–3 to T–1 days)**  \n**Deadline: July 23 (Wednesday)**  \n| Task | Owner | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n|Finalize & format pre-read artifacts| Keren Guisbert | Consolidate relevant excerpts into a short PDF or Confluence summary (HMAC workflow, test coverage matrix). |\n|Attach/share pre-read with invite| Keren Guisbert | Upload to Teams or attach to meeting invite by EOD July 23. |\n|Validate technical tools| Keren Guisbert | Ensure Microsoft Teams link works; verify screen-sharing for Cypress demo; confirm test environment access. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4 – Pre-Meeting Dry Run (T–1 day)**  \n**Deadline: July 24 (Thursday)**  \n| Task | Owner | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n|Optional dry run of Cypress demo| Keren Guisbert | Check that dynamic stubbing of x-pay-signature and timestamps works in the environment; ensure deterministic sample tests available.|\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5 – Meeting Day (T)**  \n**Date: July 25, 2025**  \n| Task | Owner | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n|Join meeting 10 minutes early| Keren Guisbert | Verify audio/video and maintain backups of pre-read locally. |\n|Lead discussion| Keren Guisbert | Focus on test gaps, improvements, and assign post-meeting follow-ups. |\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ **Key Milestones Summary**\n- **July 19:** Confirm scope, review code/docs.\n- **July 21:** Agenda drafted, pre-read outline ready.\n- **July 23:** All materials finalized and shared.\n- **July 24:** Optional dry run.\n- **July 25 @10 AM PDT:** Meeting execution.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Assumptions & Risks:\n- Meeting objective inferred from context (HMAC/Cypress coverage); confirm with Shari to avoid misalignment.\n- No other stakeholders listed yet; if QA or DevSecOps input is needed, flag ASAP.\n- Tight 7-day window: prep front-loaded over weekend; ensure weekend availability or start immediately to avoid slippage.\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ Next Action for You:\n- **Today (July 18):** Confirm agenda goals with Shari → triggers all downstream prep tasks.\n- Would you like me to **generate a 1-page pre-read outline** that includes:\n  - Cypress test current state\n  - HMAC header validation flows\n  - PCI/JSON schema checkpoints?\n\nOr should I create a **Teams-ready agenda + task checklist for execution**?", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "", "parent_assertion_id": null, "text": "The response should include a

Get buy-in from attendee (Shari). |\n| Identify and schedule any **additional attendees** | **July 15** | Keren | Determine if QA or CI pipeline owners are needed. Ensure invites sent. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Agenda & Material Development**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft **detailed agenda & discussion points** | **July 16** | Keren | Use previous deep-dive formats from engineering retrospectives as a template. |\n| Collect or prepare **test reports/screenshots** from latest Cypress runs | **July 18** | Keren (with QA / DevOps if needed) | Example: CI logs, failure trends. If reports are large, prepare summary deck. |\n| Upload all materials to **Teams channel or shared folder** | **July 21** | Keren | Consider `/security/assessments` structure or create dedicated Cypress folder. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Review & Finalization**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Share **draft agenda & materials with Shari for feedback** | **July 21 (same day as upload)** | Keren | Send via Teams or email. Allow 2 days for review. |\n| Incorporate feedback & **finalize deck and pre-reads** | **July 23** | Keren | Confirm technical accuracy and flow. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Logistics & Dry Run**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm **Teams meeting link, recording permissions** | **July 23** | Keren | Verify meeting invite in Outlook/Teams is correct. |\n| Conduct **5–10 min dry run** (optional if demos planned) | **July 24** | Keren | Validate Cypress demo scripts (if showing live tests). |\n| Distribute **final pre-read materials** to attendees | **July 24 (EOD)** | Keren | Include: agenda, links to repo/tests, expected outcomes. |\n\n---\n\n### **Day 0: Meeting Day**\n| Task | Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Check AV setup & join 5 min early | **July 25** | Keren | Prepare screen-share for Cypress results/demo. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Dependencies & Risks**\n- **Dependencies:**  \n   - Cypress test logs availability from CI environment  \n   - Confirmation of test environments and required attendees  \n- **Risks:**  \n   - Tight turnaround if additional stakeholders are required after July 15  \n   - Dry run especially important if live demo scripts exist  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Assumptions**\n- Meeting purpose = Cypress automation deep dive (not explicitly detailed, inferred from title). Adjust if agenda shifts.  \n- Only attendee in grounding data = Shari, but plan allows slot for others if needed.  \n- No pre-existing Cypress deliverable files were found — reporting tasks assume creation.\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps**\nDo you want me to:\n- **Generate a pre-formatted Teams message/email draft** to circulate this plan?  \n- **Create an agenda template** prefilled with suggested discussion topics based on prior deep dives?  \n\n---\n**Would you like me to also recommend suggested discussion points that align with your previous chaos/automation work (e.g., CI gate integration,

steps) |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Preparation – July 16–18**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft and circulate **first agenda version** | Jul 18 | Nila | Pull patterns from UnitTestWorkshop doc section: Pre-Workshop Logistics & Code Review Phase Agenda |\n| Assign code reviewers & compliance champions | Jul 18 | Nila + Shakia | Pair senior engineers with juniors (e.g., similar triads in workshop doc) |\n| Prep compliance dashboard snapshots | Jul 17 | Danille | Include SonarQube gate status, OWASP scan summary |\n| Collect inputs for agenda: critical PR list, any infra blockers | Jul 17 | All attendees | Provide topics to Nila |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Immediate Actions – July 15–16**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm attendee availability & roles | Jul 15 | Nila | Validate time zones (PST primary); send “Role in session” note |\n| Share **pre-read package**: compliance requirements, CI/CD standard excerpts | Jul 16 | Nila | Adapt from UnitTestWorkshop planning doc CI/CD Strategy section |\n| Sync with Product (Tony) on any feature risk areas | Jul 16 | Nila | Ensure compliance review aligns to roadmap priorities |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Dependencies & Risk Mitigation\n- Agenda depends on: input collection and compliance dashboard prep by Jul 18.\n- PR freeze depends on developer responsiveness; set hard cut-off Jul 20 to avoid scope creep.\n- Tight timeline: any slip in Phase 1 will compress later milestones — consider quick stand-up 10-min daily check-ins.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Assumptions & Clarifications\n- Meeting date confirmed from Event entity: **July 21, 2025**; no assumption needed.\n- No explicit agenda was provided — inferred structure from *UnitTestWorkshop_PlanningDocument.docx*.\n- Owner mapping inferred from roles:\n  - **Nila** = Organizer (Engineering Manager)\n  - **Shakia, Jack, Danille** = senior engineering & DevOps anchors\n  - Others contribute as subject-matter or compliance check participants.\n- Logistics: Online only (Teams); no physical setup.\n- If you want printed compliance checklists or breakout sessions → confirm by Jul 16.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Suggested Next Step for You\nWould you like me to:\n**(a)** Generate a **Gantt-style visual timeline**,  \n**(b)** Draft the **email for pre-read distribution (with structured agenda)**, or   \n**(c)** Create a ready-to-share **Teams message with role assignments and countdown timers**?  \n\n*(Just say \"Do (a)\", \"Do (b)\", or \"Do (c)\".)*",

Attendee mix implies DevOps and engineering compliance alignment.  \n- **Objective Signals:** Past related initiatives highlight:\n    - Pipeline changes (Jenkins, Prometheus)\n    - DevSecOps themes like rollback automation, observability, configuration governance\n- **Assumptions:** No explicit agenda listed; we infer alignment with prior observability, rollback, test coverage, and security controls referenced in files like `MigrationRollbackAutomationResearch.pdf`.  \n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Timeline (Deadline-Oriented)\n\n#### **Day 0 → Meeting Day: Mon, Jul 21 @ 15:00 PST**\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Kickoff & Outline (immediate – within 1 day)**\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm core objectives for this session (Code Review criteria + DevSecOps compliance standards) | Jul 8 | Nila Tanguma | Pull from org policies + previous security posture audits if relevant.|\n| Draft high-level agenda & share for feedback | Jul 8 | Nila Tanguma | Include time for: (a) code quality gate review (b) CI/CD security enablers (rollback guard, alerting), (c) compliance checklist walkthrough.|\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Collect Inputs & Materials (Week 1)**\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Identify code components under review (e.g., current branches: rollback guard scripts, pipeline groovy updates) | Jul 9 | Shakia G. & Jack S. | Coordinate with PR history in `pipeline-scripts` repo.|\n| Gather recent DevSecOps observability work (e.g., Grafana_MigrationRollback_Panel_DeepDive.docx, MigrationRollbackAutomationResearch.pdf) | Jul 10 | Era (Wilford can assist) | Upload to Teams/meeting files tab.|\n| Compile compliance checklist (security scanning: SAST/DAST, secret detection, dependency licenses) | Jul 10 | Terina & Shari | Reference runbook & internal compliance doc (map ticket items like LB-1249, LB-1250).|\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Agenda Finalization & Pre-reads (Week 2, early)**\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Finalize and circulate agenda | Jul 14 | Nila | Incorporate stakeholders’ feedback. Allocate discussion time by priority.|\n| Prepare and upload pre-reads: <br>• Annotated Jenkins snippet with security guard<br>• Compliance checklist draft<br>• Research doc links (MigrationRollbackAutomationResearch.pdf) | Jul 15 | Shakia & Terina | Ensure docs uploaded to the meeting invite + Teams channel.|\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Dry Run & Logistics Check**\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Validate Teams link + permissions for all attendees | Jul 17 | Nila | Pre-test screen-share and recording permissions.|\n| Quick sync with DevOps Engineers (Jack, Danille) to confirm code branch freeze for review | Jul 17 | Nila | Prevent untested merges before review session.|\n| Optional 30-min prep huddle to align presenters (observability updates, code diffs) | Jul 18 | Nila + Key SMEs | Decide demo order.|\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Final Day Checklist**\n\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm all attendees have pre-read access + reminders sent | Jul 20 | Nila | Email and Teams ping.|\n| Upload final deck/agenda to meeting invite | Jul 20 | Nila | Combine code review guide and compliance reminders.|\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Key Dependencies:\n- Agenda approval → precedes pre-reads completion (Jul 14 vs Jul 15).\n- Inputs from engineering team (scripts, compliance list) → needed for agenda.\n- Attendee alignment for any demos reliant on recent pipeline scripts.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Assumptions & Risks\n- No other blockers identified; timeline assumes immediate kickoff (Jul 8).\n- If any mandatory compliance officer review exists, loop them in by Jul 14.\n- Tight window: any slippage in material prep after Jul 15 compresses dry-run window.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Next Step for You (Nila)\n1. Confirm core meeting objectives **today**.\n2. Draft and share initial agenda by **end of Jul 8** using Teams invite thread.\n3. Assign team leads (Shakia for code snippet, Terina for compliance doc prep).\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-share Teams post with these milestones**, or convert this into **a

me make a workback plan for the upcoming meeting 'Deep Dive: Compliance Enforcement Stage Review'", "response": "Here’s your **structured workback plan** for the upcoming meeting:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Meeting Details (from enterprise data)\n- **Meeting Name:** Deep Dive: Compliance Enforcement Stage Review  \n- **Scheduled Date & Time:** Monday, **July 21, 2025**, 14:00–14:30 UTC  \n- **Organizer:** Shakia Gencarelli (you)  \n- **Attendees:** Saturnina Soyke (Director of Platform Engineering), Danille Ciardullo (DevOps Engineer), Emory Scherping, Tisa Odonoghue  \n- **Location:** Online (Teams)  \n- **Agenda (provided in event body):**  \n  - Detailed discussion on Jenkins Compliance Enforcement stage  \n    - Implementation details  \n    - Role binding  \n    - OpenSCAP integration  \n- **Current Date/Time:** July 14, 2025, 22:00 +08:00 (~7 days before meeting)  \n- **Related Context:**  \n  - Optimization & Compliance Workshop materials in **Optimization_Workshop_Planning_Document.docx**, **Integration_Test_Suite_CI_Enforcement_Detailed.docx**, and compliance checklist templates  \n  - Recent updates: Jenkins shared library enhancements, swagger-lint stage, SonarQube gates, OpenAPI ruleset referenced in prior docs  \n  - OpenSCAP integration mentioned in event but no artifact attached → will need input\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Key Assumptions & Constraints\n- Meeting confirmed for **2025-07-21**; 7 calendar days remain (5 business days).  \n- All attendees work in UTC± offset US hours, so preparation tasks targeted Mon–Fri business hours.  \n- You (Shakia) are expected to lead planning and consolidate materials.  \n- OpenSCAP integration details may not yet be centralized—assume we need to draft summary by mid-week.  \n- No pre-read explicitly listed; based on FISMA compliance governance patterns, **pre-read slide deck or doc is expected.**\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Objectives for This Workback Plan\nEnsure a **focused, well-prepared discussion** that:  \n- Has a finalized **agenda** and clear roles  \n- Provides **pre-read materials** (updated compliance enforcement stage doc + OpenSCAP approach)  \n- Captures stakeholder input on **role bindings** and Jenkins pipeline enhancements  \n- Avoids surprises: logistics confirmed, environment references ready  \n\n---\n\n# 📅 Workback Plan Timeline (Meeting Day = Mon, July 21, 14:00 UTC)\n\n### **Phase 1: Prep & Research**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Compile existing documentation on compliance enforcement | **Tue, Jul

compliance stage | **Tue, Jul 15** | Shakia | Reference: `Optimization_Workshop_Performance_Action_Tracker.xlsx` (compliance audit details tab) |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Draft Agenda & Pre-Read**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Draft expanded agenda with discussion points under each bullet (role binding, OpenSCAP, enforcement gates) | **Wed, Jul 16** | Shakia | Confirm alignment to meeting body text; circulate draft for feedback |\n| Prepare pre-read doc/slides: “Compliance Enforcement Stage Deep Dive” | **Wed, Jul 16** | Shakia | Use previous workshop content + updated Jenkins snippets; include OpenSCAP placeholder section |\n| Identify & confirm OpenSCAP integration owner input | **Wed, Jul 16** | TBD (likely Danille or Tisa) | Check if any pipeline script examples exist; add references or call out as risk if missing |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Review & Feedback**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Circulate draft agenda + pre-read to attendees for comment | **Thu, Jul 17 (AM UTC)** | Shakia | Include Danille, Tisa, Emory, Saturnina |\n| Schedule a 15-min sync with Danille & Tisa for OpenSCAP details (if gaps remain) | **Thu, Jul 17 (PM)** | Shakia | Avoid last-minute surprises; confirm integration feasibility |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Finalization & Logistics**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Incorporate feedback and finalize agenda & materials | **Fri, Jul 18 (EOD UTC)** | Shakia | Upload final to Teams/SharePoint |\n| Confirm Teams link and attendee availability | **Fri, Jul 18** | Shakia | Validate with Saturnina (Director) and all engineers |\n| Send **final meeting invite update with pre-read link & objectives** | **Fri, Jul 18 PM** | Shakia | State review expectations clearly |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Day-of Prep**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Quick dry run of talking points & ensure doc links accessible | **Mon, Jul 21 (AM)** | Shakia | Validate Jenkins snippet references; prepare fallback notes |\n| Join meeting early & test screen share | **Mon, Jul 21, 13:50 UTC** | Shakia | Bring up final materials |\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Deliverables to Watch\n- **Pre-read filename suggestion:** `ComplianceEnforcementStage_DeepDive_July21.pdf`  \n- Centralized all links:  \n  - Planning doc path: `EngineeringDocuments/Integration_Test_Suite_CI_Enforcement_Detailed.docx`  \n  - Ruleset: `openapi/compliance/ruleset.yaml` (mentioned in prior docs)  \n- Risk mitigation: If OpenSCAP input not ready by Thu, note in meeting invite and adjust expectations.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Snapshot**\n- **Today (Jul 14):** Align plan  \n- **Jul 15–16:** Gather docs, draft agenda, complete pre-read  \n- **Jul 17:** Circulate for review  \n- **Jul 18:** Finalize + confirm logistics  \n- **Jul 21:** Execute meeting confidently  \n\n---\n\n👉 Would you like me to **(a)** generate this as a

additional pipeline metrics or Trivy results not ready by 07-23, pivot by sharing placeholders + commit to follow-up doc post-meeting.\n- Time constraints: compress deck building and artifact uploads within next 24 hrs.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Summary Table**\n| Date | Key Activities |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Jul 22 (Tue)** | Pre-reads out, demo env validation, deck updates |\n| **Jul 23 (Wed)** | Agenda lock, artifact check, speakers confirm |\n| **Jul 24 (Thu AM)** | Reminder email, upload final deck, tech dry run |\n\n---\n\n### 🟢 This plan aligns with your limited prep window (2.5 days), covers agenda, artifacts, attendees, content readiness, and dry run.  \nWould you like me to **generate an editable checklist in Markdown** for reuse in Teams/Confluence OR a **visual timeline

|\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Gather technical artifacts: Jenkinsfile samples, Helm chart snippet, Trivy scan reports | **Mon, Jul 21** | Danille Ciardullo / Era Manteca | Pull latest artifacts from staging; ensure sanitization. |\n| Prepare demo-ready pipeline config (multi-stage build + scan integration) | **Mon, Jul 21** | Danille Ciardullo   | Validate in staging before uploading to repo/Teams. |\n| Update observability metrics & vulnerability remediation summary | **Mon, Jul 21** | Ossie Ziller        | Pull from prior optimization session and CI dashboards. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Review & Sync**\n| Task                                           | Due Date       | Owner

Attach latest revisions; call out focus sections: P95 alert adjustment, CVE remediation |\n| ✅ Finalize agenda & talking points alignment | **June 29, 21:00 UTC** | Terina Hafen | Lock topics: chaos metrics, alert config, remediation next steps; ensure alignment with email agenda |\n| ✅ Verify Teams meeting link & AV readiness | **June 29, 22:00 UTC** | Ossie Ziller / IT Support | Check LiveOak-Security-Team channel bridge, network policies |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Early Morning Check & Dry Run**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| ✅ Confirm all attendees have access to shared files | **June 30, 07:00 UTC** | Ossie Ziller | Validate permissions in `/security/assessments/2025-06-payments-chaos` |\n| ✅ Validate Grafana dashboard rendering & alert configs (`histogram_quantile`, P95 overlay) | **June 30, 07:30 UTC** | Jack Schrott / Sau Alquesta | Ensure v3 dashboard JSON applied in staging; check anomalies |\n| ✅ Jira ticket SEC-503 progress & alert rule set | **June 30, 08:00 UTC** | Sau Alquesta | Confirm 1.5s P95 threshold ready for discussion |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Final Hour Before Meeting**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| ✅ Draft quick reference deck with key graphs (CPU burn latency, error rate alerts, CVE table) | **June 30, 09:30 UTC** | Ashley Engel | Pull visuals from Excel & ExecSummary |\n| ✅ Post Teams reminder with links to pre-read & agenda | **June 30, 10:00 UTC** | Terina Hafen | Use LiveOak-Security-Team channel |\n| ✅ Set up live note-taking doc & capture template

Confirmation (June 29, EOD UTC)**\n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Confirm final agenda alignment** with organizer | Terina Hafen | **June 29, 18:00 UTC** | Based on agenda outlined in event body; verify no additions from security or chaos leads |\n| **Validate ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx** for completeness | Ashley Engel | **June 29, 20:00 UTC** | Ensure CVE remediation steps and alert validation details are up to date for review |\n| **Compile Prometheus alert & Grafana updates summary** | Jack Schrott | **June 29, 20:00 UTC** | Pull latest PromQL threshold tests & Grafana dashboard JSON v3.0 from staging |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Pre-read & Distribution (Latest Tonight UTC)**  \n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Prepare consolidated pre-read deck (if needed) OR annotated Excel** | Ashley Engel + Jack Schrott | **June 29, 21:00 UTC** | Merge chaos experiment results + alert adjustments in a single reference doc |\n| **Email/Teams message pre-read to all attendees** | Terina Hafen | **June 29, 22:00 UTC** | Include MS Teams link + highlight key discussion points |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Logistics & Tech Setup (Night-before + Morning-of)**  \n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Confirm meeting room booking & Teams link active** | Terina Hafen | **June 29, 23:00 UTC** | Double-check 5th Floor Conference Room setup and hybrid access |\n| **Validate dashboard and alert panels live in staging** | Jack Schrott | **June

**June 30, 10:30 UTC** | Include recording enablement for remote attendees |\n\n---\n\n## **Dependencies & Risk Notes**  \n- **Tight timeline:** All prep tasks need parallel execution – leverage group chat (#LiveOak-Security-Team) for real-time coordination.  \n- **Critical dependency:** ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx must be corrected before agenda confirmation, as it drives main Q&A focus.  \n- **Tech rehearsal skipped:** Relying on staging validation prior to meeting.  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Summary Checklist (Before 11:00 UTC, June 30):**  \n✔ Agenda confirmed  \n✔ Chaos & security data

Key Milestones (from agenda & related artifacts)\n- Finalize agenda / Q&A prompts  \n- Gather chaos engineering experiment outputs & dashboard snapshots  \n- Summarize security scan findings (from OWASP ZAP, Trivy)  \n- Prepare Grafana dashboard JSON export v3.0 confirmation  \n- Align dependency upgrade proposals & Jira ticket template  \n- Distribute pre-read packet to attendees  \n- Validate Teams link & AV setup for hybrid session  \n\n---\n\n## **WORKBACK PLAN**  \n*(Starting from meeting date and working backward, UTC is assumed)*\n\n### **Phase 1: Day of Meeting**\n| Date       | Task                                        | Owner             | Notes |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Jun 30 (Mon)** | **Conduct Brown-bag Q&A session** | Terina Hafen (Host) + All Attendees | Start 11:00 UTC |\n| Jun 30 08:30 | Final AV & Teams link test | Ossie Ziller | Verify LiveOak HQ room + Teams stream |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Final Prep**\n| Date       | Task                                        | Owner             | Notes |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Jun 29 (Sun)** | Buffer for any late slide/alert tweaks | Terina Hafen | Optional; low activity expected |\n| **Jun 27 (Fri) EOD** | Distribute pre-read packet (compiled chaos test summary, OWASP ZAP/Trivy highlights, Grafana JSON link) | Terina Hafen | PDF or Teams post; deadline firm |\n| Jun 27 | Confirm speaking order & Q&A flow | Terina Hafen, Sau Alquesta | Cross-check agenda |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Content Finalization**\n| Date       | Task                                               | Owner           | Notes |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| **Jun 26 (Thu)** | Collate experiment metrics & dashboard snapshots | Ashley Engel   | Pull CPU burn, latency charts from chaos run |\n| Jun 26 | Package OWASP ZAP & Trivy scan remediation summary | Keren Guisbert | Pull from CI security reports (latest runs) |\n| Jun 26 | Verify Grafana JSON export v3.0 vs staging dashboards | Jack Schrott | Ensure templating variables work |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Inputs & Draft Agenda**\n| Date       | Task                                       | Owner            | Notes |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| **Jun 25 (Wed)** | Draft & circulate agenda for feedback | Terina Hafen    | Include Q&A prompts |\n| Jun 25 | Identify next sprint upgrade candidates & draft Jira ticket template | Ossie Ziller + Sau Alquesta | Cross-reference with dependency matrix |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Kickoff & Early Logistics**\n| Date       | Task                                       | Owner             | Notes |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Jun 24 (Tue)** | Validate Teams link & room booking | Terina Hafen      | Confirm AV and channel pinned |\n| Jun 24 | Assign action item owners for content sections | Terina Hafen      | Ensure Ashley/Keren/Jack aligned |\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Timeline (Summary)**\n```\nJun 24: Logistics confirmed + Assign content owners\nJun 25: Agenda drafted + Next-sprint targets outlined\nJun 26: Collect chaos/security findings + Validate dashboards\nJun 27: Distribute pre-read packet (slides + dashboards)\nJun 29: Slack/Email reminder & buffer\nJun 30: Meeting day – Go live @11:00 UTC\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Dependencies & Risk Notes**\n- **Dependency:** Pre-read packet (Jun 27) depends on chaos metrics, ZAP/Trivy findings, and Grafana validation by Jun 26.\n- **Risk:** Tight turnaround if dashboard export v3.0 fails validation → Mitigate by validating JSON early on Jun 26.\n- **Assumption:** All attendees can access Teams channel and prior workshop outputs (no evidence suggests access issues).\n- **Owner Clarification:** Based on job roles + prior responsibilities from data:  \n  - Chaos experiment results → QA Engineer (Ashley Engel)  \n  - Security scan → Junior Eng. (Keren Guisbert)  \n  - Grafana export → DevOps Eng. (Jack Schrott)  \n  - Logistics & coordination → Terina Hafen  \n\n---\n\n✅ This plan covers: agenda, metrics, security summaries, dashboard readiness, Jira templates, pre-reads, and hybrid AV setup, all sequenced for a 7-day runway.\n\n---\n\n**Next step suggestion:**  \nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-share checklist or a Gantt-style visualization** for this workback plan so your team can track progress easily in Teams or Confluence?

Open Q&A / technical deep dive  \n- **Location:** LiveOak HQ – 5th Floor + Microsoft Teams link  \n- **Attachments:** No direct files linked, but related *Fraud-Security-Integration_DesignDoc.pdf* and *OWASP ZAP scan notes in pipeline chat/CI* are highly relevant to security findings.  \n- **Key Constraints:** Only 1 week to prepare. Agenda includes: chaos engineering results, security scans, alert, and dashboard updates → need coordination with DevOps + QA + Platform Eng.  \n\n---\n\n## 📆 Remaining Time\n- Meeting in 7 calendar days (June 30).  \n- That includes one weekend; effectively **5 working days** before the meeting. Timeline assumes work starts **June 24 AM UTC**.\n\n---\n\n# 🔄 Workback Plan (Backward from June 30)\n\n> **Legend:**  \n> *Notes include dependencies, assumptions, and special instructions.*\n\n---\n\n### **Day 0: Meeting Day (Mon, Jun 30)**  \n- **Task:** Host Brown-bag Session  \n  - **Due Date:** Jun 30 11:00 UTC  \n  - **Owner:** Terina Hafen (Organizer)  \n  - **Notes:** Ensure Teams link and room AV tested. Recording + transcript enabled for distribution.\n\n---\n\n### **Day -1: Final Prep (Fri, Jun 27)**  \n- **Task:** Circulate Final Pre-read Package  \n  - **Due:** Jun 27 COB UTC  \n  - **Owner:** Jack Schrott (prepare)  \n  - **Notes:** Includes:  \n    - Chaos experiment summary (CPU burn, network latency)  \n    - Security scan outputs: OWASP ZAP, Trivy remediation notes (from Jenkins pipeline)  \n    - Grafana dashboard JSON v3.0  \n    - Jira backlog proposals for next sprint upgrades  \n- **Dependencies:** Validate dashboards & alert rules complete by Jun 26.  \n\n- **Task:** Confirm Attendee Readiness + Logistics  \n  - **Due:** Jun 27  \n  - **Owner:** Terina Hafen  \n  - **Notes:** Send brief email: agenda highlights, Teams meeting link, attach final deck or doc links.  \n\n---\n\n### **Day -2: Validate Deliverables (Thu, Jun 26)**  \n- **Task:** Validate Grafana Dashboard Export v3.0  \n  - **Due:** Jun 26  \n  - **Owner:** Porsha B. (based on prior Grafana dashboard ownership) *(TBD if unavailable: assign Jack/Wilford)*  \n  - **Dependencies:** Metrics panels for payments-api chaos experiments configured.  \n  - **Notes:** Confirm JSON upload to `EngineeringDocuments/Dashboards` folder.  \n\n- **Task:** Prometheus Alert Threshold Check Review  \n  - **Due:** Jun 26  \n  - **Owner:** Jack Schrott / Wilford Taussig  \n  - **Notes:** Adjust P95/error-rate alert thresholds per chaos outputs; update YAML in `ops/prometheus/alert_rules`.  \n\n- **Task:** Dry Run / AV & Screen Share Test (Optional)  \n  - **Due:** Jun 26  \n  - **Owner:** Terina Hafen with IT  \n  - **Notes:** Verify Teams integration + room display for hybrid session.  \n\n---\n\n### **Day -3: Integrate Security Findings (Wed, Jun 25)**  \n- **Task:** Consolidate OWASP ZAP + Trivy Remediation Status  \n  - **Due:** Jun 25  \n  - **Owner:** Jack Schrott  \n  - **Dependencies:** Pull latest Jenkins `SecurityChecks` stage report (from Jun 22–24 runs).

Schelp | Ensure global attendees know it’s 11:00 UTC. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Final Prep & Dry Run**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|-------|\n| Conduct 15-min dry run: Deck review, screen share check | **June 28 (Sat)** | Terina Hafen + Jack Schrott | Focus on technical content and transitions. |\n| Print/share backup visualizations (Grafana dashboards) in case of screen issues | **June 29 (Sun)** | Wilford Taussig | Optional contingency. |\n\n---\n\n### **MEETING DAY – June 30, 2025**\n- Log in 15 min early.\n- Have open: Summary deck, Grafana dashboard, and Jira board for real-time Q&A.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Assumptions & Notes\n- All meeting details from event data are **accurate and confirmed**.\n- No notes on public holidays (US) conflicting with deadlines; timeline assumes normal working schedule.\n- Owners assigned based on security & DevOps roles from attendee list; if unclear, confirm assignments in Teams.\n- Aggressive but possible timeline → recommend daily quick sync if blockers occur.\n\n---\n\n✅ **This plan ensures all prep materials, logistics, and stakeholders are aligned before June 30 with enough buffer for review.**  \nWould you like me to **(1) generate this as a downloadable MS Planner template**, or **(2) create a Teams channel task board for tracking?**", "assertions": [{"assertion_id": "",
