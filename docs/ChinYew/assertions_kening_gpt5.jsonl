Review CPU burn and network latency experiment outcomes  \n  2. Discuss Prometheus alert threshold adjustments (P95 latency & error rate)  \n  3. Examine OWASP ZAP and Trivy scan remediation recommendations  \n  4. Validate Grafana dashboard JSON export v3.0 and templating variables  \n  5. Plan next sprint dependency upgrades and Jira ticket assignments  \n  6. Open floor for Q&A and technical deep dive  \n- **Related Files:**  \n  - *ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx* (Chaos experiments, CVE remediation, alert metrics)  \n- **Current Time:** 2025-06-29T19:00:00+08:00 (≈ June 29, 11:00 UTC) ➔ **~24 hours until meeting**  \n\n---\n\n## **Workback Timeline (Aggressive, 1-Day Prep Remaining)**\n\n### **Phase 1: Material Finalization & Agenda Confirmation (June 29, EOD UTC)**\n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Confirm final agenda alignment** with organizer | Terina Hafen | **June 29, 18:00 UTC** | Based on agenda outlined in event body; verify no additions from security or chaos leads |\n| **Validate ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx** for completeness | Ashley Engel | **June 29, 20:00 UTC** | Ensure CVE remediation steps and alert validation details are up to date for review |\n| **Compile Prometheus alert & Grafana updates summary** | Jack Schrott | **June 29, 20:00 UTC** | Pull latest PromQL threshold tests & Grafana dashboard JSON v3.0 from staging |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Pre-read & Distribution (Latest Tonight UTC)**  \n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Prepare consolidated pre-read deck (if needed) OR annotated Excel** | Ashley Engel + Jack Schrott | **June 29, 21:00 UTC** | Merge chaos experiment results + alert adjustments in a single reference doc |\n| **Email/Teams message pre-read to all attendees** | Terina Hafen | **June 29, 22:00 UTC** | Include MS Teams link + highlight key discussion points |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Logistics & Tech Setup (Night-before + Morning-of)**  \n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Confirm meeting room booking & Teams link active** | Terina Hafen | **June 29, 23:00 UTC** | Double-check 5th Floor Conference Room setup and hybrid access |\n| **Validate dashboard and alert panels live in staging** | Jack Schrott | **June 30, 07:00 UTC** | Test Prometheus histogram_quantile queries and Grafana JSON export |\n| **Double-check security scan outputs** (OWASP ZAP, Trivy) | Markita / Security delegate (TBD) | **June 30, 09:00 UTC** | Ensure updated scan reports available for discussion |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Day-of-Mtg Quick Prep**  \n| Task | Owner | Due By | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Load pre-read deck and dashboards on presentation machine** | Terina Hafen | **June 30, 10:30 UTC** | Avoid last-minute display issues |\n| **Send reminder via Teams 30 min before start** | Terina Hafen | **June 30, 10:30 UTC** | Include recording enablement for remote attendees |\n\n---\n\n## **Dependencies & Risk Notes**  \n- **Tight timeline:** All prep tasks need parallel execution – leverage group chat (#LiveOak-Security-Team) for real-time coordination.  \n- **Critical dependency:** ChaosSecurityAssessment_Details.xlsx must be corrected before agenda confirmation, as it drives main Q&A focus.  \n- **Tech rehearsal skipped:** Relying on staging validation prior to meeting.  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Summary Checklist (Before 11:00 UTC, June 30):**  \n✔ Agenda confirmed  \n✔ Chaos & security data validated  \n✔ Alerts & dashboard updates verified  \n✔ Pre-read distributed to all participants  \n✔ Meeting logistics tested  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **(A)** draft a **Teams message with all pre-read links and agenda highlights**, or **(B)** create a **checklist version of this plan for MS Planner/To Do**?", "assertions": [{"text": "The response should state that the meeting 'Brown-bag
