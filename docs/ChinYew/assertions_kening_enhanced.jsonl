**July 21:** Agenda drafted, pre-read outline ready.\n- **July 23:** All materials finalized and shared.\n- **July 24:** Optional dry run.\n- **July 25 @10 AM PDT:** Meeting execution.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠ Assumptions & Risks:\n- Meeting objective inferred from context (HMAC/Cypress coverage); confirm with Shari to avoid misalignment.\n- No other stakeholders listed yet; if QA or DevSecOps input is needed, flag ASAP.\n- Tight 7-day window: prep front-loaded over weekend; ensure weekend availability or start immediately to avoid slippage.\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ Next Action for You:\n- **Today (July 18):** Confirm agenda goals with Shari → triggers all downstream prep tasks.\n- Would you like me to **generate a 1-page pre-read outline** that includes:\n  - Cypress test current state\n  - HMAC header validation flows\n  - PCI/JSON schema checkpoints?\n\nOr should I create a **Teams-ready agenda + task checklist for execution**?", "assertions": [{"text": "The response should state the

Engineer)\n- **Attendees:** Nila Tanguma (**you**, required); Era Manteca (optional)\n- **Agenda (from event):**  \n    1. **Snyk Stage Review:** commands, threshold, dashboard integration  \n    2. **Clair CVE Scan:** invocation parameters & JIRA automation  \n    3. **Pipeline Failure Conditions:** SI-10 mapping, notifications  \n    4. **Artifact Archiving:** retention & storage schema  \n    5. **Next Steps:** rollout schedule, nightly baseline monitoring\n- **Attachments:** *Mentions “overview document” but not embedded in data*\n- **Current Time:** 2025-07-09 — **14 days before meeting**\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Observations & Assumptions\n- Time until meeting: **14 calendar days (~9 business days)**.\n- No pre-read attached; likely needs coordination.\n- User (Nila) is Engineering Manager, also owner of some Jenkins & Prometheus updates per previous action items — relevant for agenda topics.\n- No additional date uncertainty — concrete date confirmed.\n- Tasks assume minimal holiday impact.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 WORKBACK PLAN\n\n### **Phase 1: Preparation (T–14 to T–8 days)**\n| **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes** |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Confirm meeting scope & attendee list | **2025-07-10** | Nila Tanguma | Validate agenda relevance; confirm if others (e.g., Security or Ops) need to join given SI-10 and CVE scope. |\n| Gather latest pipeline metrics & issues | **2025-07-11** | Danille Ciardullo | Pull data on DevSecOps scans from Jenkins logs & Grafana to inform Snyk & Clair sections. |\n| Draft discussion outline for DevSecOps enhancements | **2025-07-11** | Nila Tanguma | Align outline to agenda points; ensure SI-10 mapping context included. |\n| Identify pre-read materials gap | **2025-07-12** | Nila Tanguma | Check if overview doc is attached elsewhere; if missing, request from Danille. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Content Development (T–7 to T–4 days)**  \n| **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes** |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Finalize security scan status summary (Snyk, Clair) | **2025-07-15** | Danille Ciardullo | Include any threshold adjustments or automation hooks from prior sprints. |\n| Compile SI-10 compliance checklist for failure conditions | **2025-07-16** | Era Manteca (Support) | Outline which pipeline steps map to SI-10, prepare draft doc or table. |\n| Prepare artifact archiving schema notes | **2025-07-16** | Nila Tanguma | Validate retention period & storage policies align with governance. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Pre-Read & Logistics (T–3 to T–1 days)**  \n| **Task** | **Due Date** | **Owner** | **Notes** |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Consolidate all briefing materials (overview + updates) | **2025-07-18** | Nila Tanguma | Combine into single doc or share link for quick reference. |\n| Send final pre-read packet & Zoom reminder | **2025-07-22** | Nila Tanguma | Ensure email includes agenda, Zoom link, and attached summary. |\n| Validate Zoom link & tech readiness | **2025-07-22** | Danille Ciardullo | Quick check for screen-sharing permissions, network stability. |\n\n---\n\n### **Day-of Meeting (T = 2025-07-23)**  \n| **Task** | **Time** | **Owner** | **Notes** |\n|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Join early & load slides | **10:55 PST** | Nila & Danille | Keep agenda and notes ready; allocate 5 min for AV check. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Key Dependencies\n- Final agenda confirmation requires Danille’s alignment on pipeline enhancements.\n- SI-10 checklist drafting depends on latest compliance mapping documents.\n- Pre-read distribution is critical by **July 22** → ensure no slip.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation\n- **Risk:** Missing overview document could delay context-sharing.  \n  **Mitigation:** Escalate request to Danille by July 12 if not received.\n- **Risk:** Optional attendee (Era) may need actionable SI-10 items.  \n  **Mitigation:** Confirm Era’s role when validating attendee list July 10.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Would you like me to:\n**A)** Generate this as a shareable **Excel/Gantt chart** with color-coded phases  \n**B)** Produce a **Teams-ready summary message** for quick posting  \n**C)** Expand with

4: Day of Meeting – July 21, 2025**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm tech setup & security checks | Jul 21, 12:00 PST | Danille (DevOps) | Ensure Teams link active; CI dashboards accessible; verify screen share permissions |\n| Distribute final agenda + link again | Jul 21, 09:00 PST | Nila | Include compliance checklist; highlight required PRs for review |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Finalization – July 19–20**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Freeze pull request list for review | Jul 20 (EOD) | Shakia | Identify target PRs affecting security or compliance |\n| Validate dry run of compliance scan (CI/CD gates) | Jul 19 | Jack | Run SonarQube & Jenkinsfile coverage.groovy pipeline parameters align with compliance thresholds (≥90%) |\n| Draft final discussion points & time allocations | Jul 19 | Nila | Mirror structure in UnitTestWorkshop doc (intro → code review → compliance demo → next steps) |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Preparation – July 16–18**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Draft and circulate **first agenda version** | Jul 18 | Nila | Pull patterns from UnitTestWorkshop doc section: Pre-Workshop Logistics & Code Review Phase Agenda |\n| Assign code reviewers & compliance champions | Jul 18 | Nila + Shakia | Pair senior engineers with juniors (e.g., similar triads in workshop doc) |\n| Prep compliance dashboard snapshots | Jul 17 | Danille | Include SonarQube gate status, OWASP scan summary |\n| Collect inputs for agenda: critical PR list, any infra blockers | Jul 17 | All attendees | Provide topics to Nila |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Immediate Actions – July 15–16**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Confirm attendee availability & roles | Jul 15 | Nila | Validate time zones (PST primary); send “Role in session” note |\n| Share **pre-read package**: compliance requirements, CI/CD standard excerpts | Jul 16 | Nila | Adapt from UnitTestWorkshop planning doc CI/CD Strategy section |\n| Sync with Product (Tony) on any feature risk areas | Jul 16 | Nila | Ensure compliance review aligns to roadmap priorities |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Dependencies & Risk Mitigation\n- Agenda depends on: input collection and compliance dashboard prep by Jul 18.\n- PR freeze depends on developer responsiveness; set hard cut-off Jul 20 to avoid scope creep.\n- Tight timeline: any slip in Phase 1 will compress later milestones — consider quick stand-up 10-min daily check-ins.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Assumptions & Clarifications\n- Meeting date confirmed from Event entity: **July 21, 2025**; no assumption needed.\n- No explicit agenda was provided — inferred structure from *UnitTestWorkshop_PlanningDocument.docx*.\n- Owner mapping inferred from roles:\n  - **Nila** = Organizer (Engineering Manager)\n  - **Shakia, Jack, Danille** = senior engineering & DevOps anchors\n  - Others contribute as subject-matter or compliance check participants.\n- Logistics: Online only (Teams); no physical setup.\n- If you want printed compliance checklists or breakout sessions → confirm by Jul 16.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Suggested Next Step for You\nWould you like me to:\n**(a)** Generate a **Gantt-style visual timeline**,  \n**(b)** Draft the **email for pre-read

Draft short agenda structure in Teams invite**: Intro → Pipeline Stage Walkthrough → Security/Gating Controls → OpenSCAP Role Bindings → Q&A | 2025-07-21 10:00 UTC | Saturnina | Post the agenda to chat for alignment. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Pre-Meeting Finalization**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| **7. Confirm demo environment readiness** – If live snippet view or config review needed | 2025-07-21 11:00 UTC | Danille | Optional but recommended; confirm Jenkins job access. |\n| **8. Prepare key talking points & risk callouts** – role-based permissions, rollback triggers, sign-off gate timeline | 2025-07-21 12:30 UTC | Saturnina | Keep this in personal notes for guiding discussion. |\n\n---\n\n### **Meeting Day Checklist (30 min before start)**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| **9. Upload final files to meeting chat** | 2025-07-21 13:30 UTC | Saturnina | Ensure **Liquibase_Audit_Annotation_Checklist.xlsx** & snippet available. |\n| **10. Confirm recording & attendees joined early** | 2025-07-21 13:45 UTC | Saturnina | Hit record if required for compliance evidence. |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Key Dependencies & Risks\n- **Dependencies:** Danille’s Compliance Enforcement snippet and Shakia’s TLS configs are critical references; ensure both are accessible.\n- **Risks:** Only ~16 hours until go-live. Limited buffer; avoid scope creep (stick to compliance stage review).\n- **Mitigation:** Use messaging now to prime attendees; assume no time for significant doc revisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Assumptions**\n- Meeting objective remains as per invite: pipeline compliance enforcement, not full rollout readiness.\n- No additional attendees beyond current list.\n- No reschedule.\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ This plan focuses on essential prep and artifact readiness under tight time frame.  \nWould you like me to **(a) draft the pre-read email template citing exact file names and agenda sections**, or **(b) produce a visual timeline (Gantt-style) for your executive view**?", "assertions": [{"text": "The response should explicitly state the meeting start time as 2025-07-21
