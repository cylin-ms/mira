Motivation for dynamic cache resizing3. Resizing algorithm parameters4. Metrics instrumentation approach5. Performance benchmark results6. Integration test enhancements7. Parameterization and configuration8. Prometheus alert tuning9. Roadmap and next steps10. Q&ASlide 3: Introduction and Workshop Recap• On July 22, 2025, led a 90-minute session in #jwt-cache-optimizations• Focus areas:   – @NotNull annotation enforcement   – Exception handling improvements   – Pipeline stress-test corrections   – Live code review of PR-213 and PR-216• Outcome: Updated JWT cache metrics and bug reports (BUG-1805)Slide 4: Motivation for Dynamic Cache Resizing• Static cache sizes lead to:   – Under-provisioning: frequent evictions, increased latency   – Over-provisioning: wasted memory, higher GC overhead• Observed thrash warning spikes during load tests (jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total >3)• Goal: adapt cache capacity to workload patternsSlide 5: Resizing Algorithm Parameters[Figure: Diagram of resize triggers]• Upsize when miss rate >1% over evaluation window• Downsize when miss rate <0.2% and cache utilization <50%• Parameters:   – upSize = 50 entries   – downSize = 25 entries   – minCapacity = 128 entries   – maxCapacity = 512 entries   – cooldownPeriod = 10 minutes between adjustmentsSlide 6: Metrics Instrumentation Approach[Image: Code snippet]• Added cache_size label to jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total counter:  counter.labels(String.valueOf(currentCapacity)).increment();• New gauge: jwt_cache_current_size gauge{cache_size}• Emitted readiness probe metric: ci_vault_ready_duration_secondsSlide 7: Performance Benchmark Results[Graph: P95 latency vs cache size]• Warm-cache P95: 1.4ms• Cold-cache P95: 4.7ms• Dynamic resizing reduces cold-cache impact by 15%• Thrash warnings decreased from 5 to 2 spikes in 10m windowSlide 8: Integration Test Enhancements• Jenkins waitForVaultReady step added to prevent race conditions• Parameterized integration tests for varying cacheSizes in JwtCacheLRUIntegrationTest v2.1• Validation of labeled metrics presence in PrometheusSlide 9: Parameterization and Configuration• YAML schema validated via jsonschema• Introduced new config section:  cacheResizing:    upSize: ${upSize}    downSize: ${downSize}    minCapacity: ${minCapacity}    maxCapacity: ${maxCapacity}    evaluationWindow: 5m    cooldownPeriod: 10m• Hot-reload support planned for next releaseSlide 10: Prometheus Alert Tuning[Image: Alert rule snippet]• Updated thrash warning alert:  sum_over_time(jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total[10m]) by (cache_size) > 2 for 5m• Added eviction overflow alert:  increase(jwt_cache_overflow_total[1h]) > 0Slide 11: Roadmap and Next Steps• Merge dynamic resizing PR and release v1.1.0 (July 28)• Add hot-reload endpoints and config UI by August 5• Monitor production metrics for 2 weeks, adjust thresholds• Schedule follow-up workshop on microservices integration (EventId:09522e28-216e-482e-8a4d-52b053fa8529)Slide 12: Q&A• Thank you!

      "Content": "Deep Dive: End-to-End Vulnerability Scan Architecture and Metrics IntegrationIn the aftermath of our DevSecOps sprint, we are documenting the detailed architecture and signal flow that underpins our automated vulnerability assessment process. The primary goal of this document is to capture the integration points between Jenkins, Snyk, Filebeat, Logstash, and Prometheus, and to articulate the design decisions that enable reliable scanning, reporting, and alerting.The first phase of the integration centers on the injection of the Snyk scan step into our Jenkins pipeline. Within the Post-Test-Gates stage, we invoke the shared security-scans library by calling runSnyk() immediately after compilation and unit testing. This approach ensures that vulnerability assessments occur before any artifacts are promoted. We leverage a withCredentials block to retrieve the SNYK_TOKEN secret, and the pipeline is configured to execute npm run build && mvn test && snyk test. By capturing the JSON output to stdout, we maintain a consistent invocation pattern that can be parsed downstream.Once the scan completes, the Go snippet developed by Emory Scherping captures the native Snyk JSON response and emits it as a series of structured log entries. This output is consumed by Filebeat’s multiline JSON parser, which aggregates the payload into coherent events. Our logstash.telemetry.conf, authored by Markita Sitra, applies a mutate filter that maps the exit code to @metadata.scan_status and extracts key metrics—such as the counts of medium, high, and critical vulnerabilities—into discrete fields. The use of metadata parsing ensures that we can replay and replay events without altering the underlying JSON structure.From Logstash, we forward enriched events to two distinct destinations: an artifact store and a Prometheus PushGateway. The artifact store retains a full Snyk report under builds/${BUILD_ID}/security/secure-scan-report.json for audit purposes, while the PushGateway accepts two metrics: security_scan_pass and security_scan_fail. We label each metric with build_id, commit_hash, and scan_status. This design enables Grafana dashboards to visualize failure rates over time and correlate build health with vulnerability trends. Additionally, alert rules in Prometheus trigger when we detect a new high or critical severity finding, enforcing immediate investigation protocols.To support compliance and policy tuning, we introduced a configurable threshold module that references our Confluence schema contract. Terina Hafen’s proposal to raise the critical severity block from zero to one is implemented via a policy file mutation step that precedes the Snyk invocation. This allows us to adjust thresholds without modifying the Jenkinsfile itself, reducing merge conflicts and centralizing policy management.Looking forward, the next phase will be to instrument downstream dashboards with anomaly detection on vulnerability incidence, and to extend our Filebeat-Logstash pipeline to capture remediation actions. We will also explore exporting Snyk scan trends to our central data warehouse for long-term analytics. By codifying each stage of this architecture, we ensure that security scanning remains a transparent, auditable, and continuous component of our CI/CD process.",

      "Content": "This document examines the strategies employed to prevent rapid oscillation, or \"thrash\", in the dynamic resizing mechanism of our JSON Web Token LRU cache. As our platform responds to varying load conditions, it is critical to ensure that capacity adjustments do not introduce instability. Thrash prevention is achieved by enforcing a configurable cooldown period between resize operations and by monitoring resize events to warn when thresholds are exceeded.In a dynamic resizing model, the cache adapts its capacity in response to miss-rate and CPU utilization metrics. When the miss-rate exceeds the defined threshold over the evaluation window, the cache increases its size by the up_size parameter. Similarly, when CPU usage climbs above its threshold and the hit-rate remains high, the cache decreases in size. Without proper controls, these adjustments can oscillate rapidly, leading to cache thrashing and unpredictable performance.To mitigate this risk, the cache_settings.yaml schema includes a cooldown_period property that defines the minimum interval between successive resize actions. This period is measured from the timestamp of the last applied resize event. During this interval, further resize triggers are ignored, and any attempts to adjust the cache size increment a thrash warning counter. By capturing these events in jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, we gain visibility into how often resize requests are suppressed.The CacheResizerService in the authentication microservice implements this logic. After fetching metrics from Prometheus via the metrics client, it evaluates conditions such as:    long elapsed = now - lastResizeTime;    if (missRate > config.getMissThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize + config.getUpSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else if (cpuUtil > config.getCpuThreshold() && hitRate > config.getHitThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize - config.getDownSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else {        thrashWarningsCounter.increment();    }This approach ensures that cache size adjustments occur no more frequently than configured, and that any suppressed triggers are accounted for. The updateCapacity method performs boundary checks against minCapacity and maxCapacity before applying changes.On the monitoring side, we introduce a Prometheus recording rule that accumulates jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, and a Grafana panel that overlays the warning counter with jwt_cache_current_size. This correlation allows engineers to quickly identify periods where the cache reached its cooldown limit. An alert can be configured to fire when thrash warnings increment multiple times within a short timeframe, indicating that operational thresholds may need tuning.Finally, we integrate thrash regression tests into our CI pipeline. The test suite simulates continuous miss-rate spikes and verifies that no more than one resize event occurs per cooldown period. This is achieved by injecting mock metrics and advancing the internal clock within the CacheResizerService. Any deviation from expected behavior fails the build, providing immediate feedback.In production, runbook procedures include instructions to inspect the thrash warning metrics and to adjust cooldown settings if necessary. By combining configuration controls, robust implementation, and comprehensive monitoring, we ensure that dynamic resizing enhances cache efficiency without sacrificing system stability.",

It highlights alert triggers, root cause identification, remediation timeline, and SLA impact metrics.Table: Timeline of Events| Time (UTC)           | Event                                      | Owner      | Outcome                                                   ||----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|| 2025-07-23 08:32:00Z | SLA dashboard alert latency threshold hit  | monitoring | 15% of requests >200ms, auth CPU spiked to 80%            || 2025-07-23 08:35:00Z | Root cause analysis complete               | shakiag    | Identified synchronous file I/O on cache miss path        || 2025-07-23 08:49:00Z | Blue-green deployment of cache patch       | wilfordt   | Warm cache hit rate improved, latency stabilized <180ms    || 2025-07-23 08:54:00Z | Service recovered under SLA threshold      | monitoring | Error rates returned to baseline                          |Metric Summary: Warm cache avg latency 1.2ms (σ=0.3ms), Cold cache avg 4.5ms (σ=0.7ms), Cache hit rate sustained at 99.5%.Slide 2: Deep Dive into Root Cause and Verification PathParagraph: The JWT validation flow consists of header parsing, payload decoding, and signature verification. Under cache miss the fallback path performed synchronous disk reads for the public key, causing repeated 3–5ms latency spikes under peak load.Process Flow:1. Parse JWT header and extract kid2. Check in-memory LRU cache (256-entry capacity)3. On cache hit: constant-time lookup to signature verification4. On cache miss: synchronous fs read of public key file, then signature verificationFlame graph analysis shows the disk I/O call consuming 40% of execution time in miss scenarios, confirmed by New Relic traces.Slide 3: Extended Performance AnalysisParagraph: Microbenchmark and production metrics over high-load tests (10k RPS) validate stability and regression boundaries.Table: Performance Metrics Across Environments| Scenario            | P50 Latency | P95 Latency | P99 Latency | Avg Latency | Std Dev ||---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|| Warm Cache (Test)   | 0.9ms       | 1.4ms       | 2.1ms       | 1.2ms       | 0.15ms  || Cold Cache (Test)   | 3.8ms       | 4.7ms       | 5.6ms       | 4.5ms       | 0.7ms   || Warm Cache (Prod)   | 1.1ms       | 1.6ms       | 2.4ms       | 1.3ms       | 0.2ms   || Cold Cache (Prod)   | 4.0ms       | 5.0ms       | 6.0ms       | 4.7ms       | 0.8ms   |Observations: Production results are within 10% of test harness metrics and show no regressions post-deployment.Slide 4: Roadmap and Action ItemsParagraph: To ensure resilience and adaptability, the following roadmap outlines targeted deliverables and deadlines.Action Items:- AI-007: Integrate end-to-end load tests for key rotation scenarios (Owner: porshab, Due: 2025-07-31)- AI-008: Implement dynamic cache resizing triggers based on miss-rate and CPU thresholds (Owner: bevmcg, Due: 2025-08-02)- AI-009: Enhance telemetry with cache hit/miss time-series panels in Grafana (Owner: wilfordt, Due: 2025-07-30)- AI-010: Update incident runbook with dynamic resize and cooldown verification commands (Owner: bevmcg, Due: 2025-07-29)Slide 5: Risk Assessment and Mitigation StrategiesParagraph: Potential risks of dynamic resizing include oscillation and performance regressions. Mitigation includes enforced cooldown periods, parameterized thresholds, and rollback via blue-green deployment and smoke tests.Detailed mitigation table and configuration references are documented in auth_service/config/cache_settings.yaml and the incident runbook (DOC-1123).",
