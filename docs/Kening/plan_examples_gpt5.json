No major scope changes will occur after Jan 7 feature freeze.  \n2. All attendees are available for the Jan 15 meeting without conflicts.  \n3. Legal review will be completed by Jan 3 as planned.  \n\n---\n\n## **Risks & Mitigations**\n- **Risk 1:** Engineering sign-off delayed → **Mitigation:** Add buffer day (Jan 12) and escalate to Sarah if not signed off by EOD Jan 11.  \n- **Risk 2:** Legal review not completed → **Mitigation:** Sarah to follow up with Legal on Jan 2 and have contingency plan for updated Terms post-launch if permissible.  \n- **Risk 3:** QA validation uncovers critical defects → **Mitigation:** Keep Jan 12 buffer for fixes; prioritize severity 1 issues only.  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis workback plan ensures all readiness tasks, dependencies, and stakeholder confirmations are completed before the **Q1 Product Launch Readiness Review** on **January 15, 2025, 2:00 PM PST**, enabling the team to finalize the launch checklist and proceed confidently toward the February 1 launch date.
