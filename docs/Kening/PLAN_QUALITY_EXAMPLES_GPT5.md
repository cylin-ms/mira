**Buffer Days:** Built-in buffer between Jan 12 and Jan 14 for unforeseen delays.

---

## **Dependencies**
- **Engineering sign-off (Jan 11)** must occur **before QA final validation (Jan 12)**.  
- **Design assets (Jan 10)** must be finalized before marketing and readiness confirmation.  
- **Legal review** must be confirmed by Jan 3 to avoid launch delays.  

---

## **Ownership Summary**
- **Sarah Chen:** Meeting organization, checklist updates, stakeholder alignment, legal confirmation.  
- **Mike Johnson:** Engineering freeze, final sign-off, status report.  
- **Lisa Park:** Design asset finalization and summary update.  
- **Tom Wilson:** QA test validation and report updates.  

---

## **Stakeholder Alignment Steps**
- **Jan 6:** Sarah drafts pre-read summary and circulates for comments.  
- **Jan 13:** Sarah confirms alignment via email with all attendees and key stakeholders.  

---

## **Assumptions**
1. No major scope changes will occur after Jan 7 feature freeze.  
2. All attendees are available for the Jan 15 meeting without conflicts.  
3. Legal review will be completed by Jan 3 as planned.  

---

## **Risks & Mitigations**
- **Risk 1:** Engineering sign-off delayed → **Mitigation:** Add buffer day (Jan 12) and escalate to Sarah if not signed off by EOD Jan 11.  
- **Risk 2:** Legal review not completed → **Mitigation:** Sarah to follow up with Legal on Jan 2 and have contingency plan for updated Terms post-launch if permissible.  
- **Risk 3:** QA validation uncovers critical defects → **Mitigation:** Keep Jan 12 buffer for fixes; prioritize severity 1 issues only.  

---

### **Summary**
This workback plan ensures all readiness tasks, dependencies, and stakeholder confirmations are completed before the **Q1 Product Launch Readiness Review** on **January 15, 2025, 2:00 PM PST**, enabling the team to finalize the launch checklist and proceed confidently toward the February 1 launch date.

Critical gaps include missing full attendee details, unassigned tasks, and omission of one required artifact. Aspirational elements like assumptions, stakeholder alignment, and risk mitigation are absent.
