# Workback Plan Quality Examples & Evaluation Report

> **Generated by GPT-5 JJ:** 2025-11-28 13:17

> **Purpose:** Demonstrate two-layer evaluation: Structural (P1-P10) + Grounding (G1-G5)

## Key Insight: Specificity ≠ Grounding

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Bad Specificity** | Hardcoded values that don't generalize | "Must mention Sarah Chen" |
| **Good Grounding** | Parameterized verification against source | "All people must exist in source.attendees" |

**The Two-Layer Framework:**
- **Structural Patterns (P1-P10):** "Does the plan HAVE the right shape?"
- **Grounding Assertions (G1-G5):** "Are those elements FACTUALLY CORRECT?"

**Critical Rule:** A plan that passes structural checks but fails grounding is **WORSE** than one that is incomplete but accurate. Hallucinated plans with good structure can mislead users.

**Buffer:**  
- Built-in buffer of 1-2 days before Jan 15 for any last-minute adjustments (tasks complete by Jan 13).

---

## **Dependencies**
- **Engineering sign-off (Jan 11)** must occur **before QA final validation (Jan 12)**.  
- **Design assets finalized (Jan 10)** before marketing readiness confirmation.  
- **Legal review** must be confirmed (Jan 03) before final checklist update.  

---

## **Ownership Assignment**
- **Sarah Chen:** Agenda prep, checklist updates, stakeholder alignment, legal follow-up, pre-read consolidation.  
- **Mike Johnson:** Engineering build sign-off, bug fixes, Engineering_Status_Report.pdf updates.  
- **Lisa Park:** Finalize design assets, update Design_Assets_Summary.docx.  
- **Tom Wilson:** QA validation, update QA_Test_Results_Jan.pdf.  

---

## **Stakeholder Alignment Steps**
- **Jan 07:** Internal alignment call to review preliminary readiness status.  
- **Jan 14:** Circulate final agenda and pre-read packet for review and confirmation from all attendees.  

---

## **Assumptions**
1. No major new feature requests will be introduced after Jan 06.  
2. Legal review team will provide feedback by Jan 03.  
3. All attendees are available for the Jan 15 meeting and alignment calls.  

---

## **Risks & Mitigation**
- **Risk 1:** Engineering sign-off delayed due to unresolved bugs.  
  - *Mitigation:* Daily bug triage from Jan 06–Jan 10; escalate blockers to Sarah Chen immediately.  
- **Risk 2:** Legal review not completed by Jan 03.  
  - *Mitigation:* Sarah to follow up with legal daily starting Dec 30; have contingency plan for interim approval.  
- **Risk 3:** QA validation uncovers critical issues on Jan 12.  
  - *Mitigation:* Early smoke testing starting Jan 08; allocate hotfix resources.  

---

## **Summary**
This workback plan ensures that all readiness tasks, dependencies, and stakeholder inputs are addressed before the **Q1 Product Launch Readiness Review** on **January 15, 2025, at 2:00 PM PST**, providing sufficient buffer and risk mitigation for a successful meeting and on-time launch.  

## Two-Layer Evaluation Results

### Quality Verdict: ✅ EXCELLENT - Complete and Accurate

| Layer | Score | Max | Percentage |
|-------|-------|-----|------------|
| Structural (P1-P10) | 100 | 100 | 100% |
| Grounding (G1-G5) | 44 | 50 | 88% |
| **Combined** | **144** | **150** | **96%** |

### Layer 1: Structural Evaluation (Does the plan HAVE the right elements?)

The workback plan meets all structural requirements, including clear meeting details, backward timeline with buffer, explicit ownership, artifact handling, dependencies, and assumptions. It also includes stakeholder alignment steps and risk mitigation, making it structurally complete and well-formed.

### Layer 2: Grounding Evaluation (Are those elements FACTUALLY CORRECT?)

The workback plan is mostly grounded in the source data, with accurate attendees, dates, and topics. However, it introduces one new artifact (QA_Test_Results_Jan.pdf) that was not in the source list, causing minor grounding issues. Overall, the plan is factually accurate with a small deviation.

## Two-Layer Evaluation Results

### Quality Verdict: ⚠️ NEEDS WORK - Accurate but incomplete

| Layer | Score | Max | Percentage |
|-------|-------|-----|------------|
| Structural (P1-P10) | 49 | 100 | 49% |
| Grounding (G1-G5) | 45 | 50 | 90% |
| **Combined** | **94** | **150** | **63%** |

### Layer 1: Structural Evaluation (Does the plan HAVE the right elements?)

The workback plan includes a clear timeline and avoids introducing extraneous elements, but it lacks full attendee details, some artifact preparation tasks, explicit dependencies, and risk considerations. Several tasks are unassigned, and the meeting purpose is not fully articulated. Overall structural completeness is moderate but needs improvement for critical readiness.

### Layer 2: Grounding Evaluation (Are those elements FACTUALLY CORRECT?)

The workback plan is mostly grounded in the source data, with accurate attendees, dates, files, and topics. However, it introduces minor variations in task descriptions related to dependencies, which count as slight hallucinations. Overall, the plan is factually aligned but not perfectly literal to the source.

## Two-Layer Evaluation Results

### Quality Verdict: 🚫 POOR - Incomplete and inaccurate

| Layer | Score | Max | Percentage |
|-------|-------|-----|------------|
| Structural (P1-P10) | 7 | 100 | 7% |
| Grounding (G1-G5) | 25 | 50 | 50% |
| **Combined** | **32** | **150** | **21%** |

### Layer 1: Structural Evaluation (Does the plan HAVE the right elements?)

The workback plan fails most structural checks. It lacks accurate meeting details, explicit owners, artifact references, and a clear backward timeline. Overall, the plan is incomplete and introduces inconsistencies, making it structurally weak.

| Assertion | Pattern | Level | Pass/Fail | Score | Evidence |

### Layer 2: Grounding Evaluation (Are those elements FACTUALLY CORRECT?)

The workback plan partially aligns with the source data but fails on attendee accuracy and meeting date/time. It introduces one hallucinated attendee and changes the meeting schedule. File and topic references are consistent with the source.

# Summary Comparison

| Quality | Structural | Grounding | Combined | Verdict |
|---------|------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Perfect** | 100/100 | 44/50 | 144/150 | EXCELLENT |
| **Medium** | 49/100 | 45/50 | 94/150 | NEEDS WORK |
| **Low** | 7/100 | 25/50 | 32/150 | POOR |

## Quality Matrix

| Scenario | Structural (P1-P10) | Grounding (G1-G5) | Verdict |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Complete & Accurate | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass | **EXCELLENT** |
| Complete but Hallucinated | ✅ Pass | ❌ Fail | **REJECT** ⚠️ |
| Accurate but Incomplete | ❌ Fail | ✅ Pass | **NEEDS WORK** |
| Neither | ❌ Fail | ❌ Fail | **POOR** |

**Minimum Requirements for Acceptance:**
- Structural: ≥60/100 with all critical patterns (P1, P2, P3, P9) passing
- Grounding: ≥40/50 (no more than 1 hallucination)

---

## Human Judge Guidelines

### Priority Order (Revised)
1. **Grounding (G1-G5)** - Factual accuracy FIRST
2. **Critical Structural (P1, P2, P3, P9)** - Essential elements
3. **Expected Structural (P4, P5, P6)** - Standard quality
4. **Aspirational (P7, P8, P10)** - Excellence indicators

### Why Grounding First?
A beautifully structured plan with the wrong meeting date, fabricated attendees, or non-existent files is **worse than useless** - it actively misleads the user.
