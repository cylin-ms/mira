{"utterance": "Help me make a workback plan for the upcoming meeting '1:1 Action Items Review'", "response": "Here’s a comprehensive, **actionable workback plan** for the upcoming meeting, grounded entirely on the provided enterprise data:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Meeting Details\n- **Meeting Subject:** `1:1 Action Items Review`\n- **Scheduled Date:** **Saturday, July 26, 2025**\n- **Time:** 14:00–14:30 PST (per calendar EventId: `0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a`)\n- **Organizer:** Tisa Odonoghue (DevOps Engineer)\n- **Attendee(s):**  \n  - Nila Tanguma (Engineering Manager)  \n- **Location:** Online (Teams Meeting link provided)\n- **Current Time:** July 23, 2025, 22:00 +08:00 → roughly **2.5 days away**\n- **Objective:** Review action items from recent initiatives (context strongly tied to ongoing platform activities such as Jenkins security pipeline upgrades, compliance enforcement rollout, vault integration work, per multiple threads and files authored by Tisa).\n\n---\n\n## ⏪ Time Analysis\nToday (Jul 23, late evening APAC) → Meeting (Jul 26, 14:00 PST).  \n**Available prep time:** ~2.5 days (including only one weekday and part of Friday US time).  \n**Implication:** Tight schedule. Prioritize deliverables and confirm dependencies ASAP.\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation Goals Anchored on Context**\n- Integration work referenced in numerous recent messages:\n  - Jenkins security pipeline (parallelization, failure gating logic – see *Jenkinsfile.security.groovy*, DAST gating snippet)\n  - Vault Secret Management (Tisa authored a technical deep dive PDF on July 23)\n  - Compliance enforcement stage (mentions of staging dry run, Liquibase annotations, rollback metrics readiness)\n- Meeting likely to be a 1:1 checkpoint with Nila (an Engineering Manager) to confirm:  \n  - Status of compliance tasks  \n  - Pipeline enhancement progress  \n  - Documentation readiness  \n  - Any remaining risk items (rollback safeguards, Prometheus alerts, Confluence updates)\n\n---\n\n# **Workback Plan for “1:1 Action Items Review” (Meeting: 2025-07-26, 14:00 PST)**\n\n### **PHASE 1: TODAY THROUGH JULY 24 (Planning & Alignment)**\n**1. Confirm Meeting Objectives & Scope**\n- **Due:** Jul 24 EOD PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Notes:** Validate whether Nila expects focus on:\n  - Compliance stage rollout & OpenSCAP scans  \n  - Vault token reuse optimization (staging test post-matrix parallelization)  \n  - Liquibase audit rule enforcement status  \n- **Dependency:** None; email/Teams ping Nila for clarity.\n\n**2. Consolidate Open Items from Recent Threads**\n- **Due:** Jul 24 EOD PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Notes:** Pull from:\n  - Compliance Enforcement Stage Chat (#platform-planning)  \n  - Strategy doc: *Compliance_Enforcement_Snippet.groovy*  \n  - Vault Deep Dive PDF (File: `Vault_Secret_Management_Deep_Dive.pdf`)  \n- **Output:** Draft list of open action items (e.g., retroactiveScan signoff, rollback metrics PR merge).\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 2: MAIN PREP (JULY 25)**\n**3. Draft 1-Pager for Discussion**\n- **Due:** Jul 25, 14:00 PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Notes:** Summarize:\n  - Action items status + blockers  \n  - References to prior deep dives (*FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx*, *Security_Automation_Outcomes_DeepDive.pptx*)  \n  - Highlight due dates vs current progress (+ any JIRA tags like FEDRAMP-102/103 if applicable)\n- **Dependency:** Phase 1 output finalized.\n\n**4. Verify Artifact Accessibility**\n- **Due:** Jul 25, COB PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Notes:** Ensure:\n  - Latest Jenkinsfile/security snippets accessible in repo  \n  - Confluence links for runbook & compliance gating docs live  \n  - Metrics dashboards and PromQL queries validated in Grafana \n- **Risk:** Metrics panel sync requires coordination with ops (Danille) – flag early.\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 3: FINAL TOUCHPOINT (JULY 26 MORNING)**\n**5. Final Review & Prep Meeting Notes**\n- **Due:** Jul 26, 09:00 PST  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Deliverable:**  \n  - Confirm Teams meeting link functionality  \n  - Rehearse key points (compliance scan status, Liquibase annotations, rollback metrics, schedule for next steps)\n- **Dependency:** Completed 1-pager ready to share on call.\n\n**6. Share Pre-Read (Optional but Recommended)**\n- **Due:** Jul 26, 2 hours before meeting  \n- **Owner:** Tisa  \n- **Content:** PDF or Teams message with:\n  - Summary of action items vs status  \n  - Links to critical docs:\n    - `Vault_Secret_Management_Deep_Dive.pdf`\n    - `Security_Automation_Outcomes_DeepDive.pptx`\n    - `FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx`\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Assumptions & Risks**\n- Meeting agenda is inferred from context (recent compliance, pipeline, and secret management initiatives).\n- Only Nila is confirmed attendee from calendar. If others join, adjust pre-read distribution.\n- Very tight timeline: any slip in consolidation (Phase 1) will compress review time.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Practicality Check\n- **2.5 days total** → immediate action is critical. Most tasks align with Tisa’s role (pipeline owner).\n- Slack time minimal; bake in dependency checks early (e.g., metric validation may need Danille/Saul).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table View**\n\n| Task                                      | Due Date       | Owner | Notes                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Confirm objectives with Nila            | Jul 24 EOD    | Tisa  | Align expectations; adjust prep if needed                        |\n| Consolidate open action items           | Jul 24 EOD    | Tisa  | Pull from Jenkins, Vault, Compliance threads                     |\n| Draft 1-pager summary                   | Jul 25 14:00  | Tisa  | Include key files & progress summary                             |\n| Verify artifact access (Jenkins, Grafana)| Jul 25 COB    | Tisa  | Metric dashboards, snippets, Confluence docs                     |\n| Final review & discussion prep          | Jul 26 09:00  | Tisa  | Dry run key points; ensure meeting link active                   |\n| Share pre-read pack                     | Jul 26 ~12:00 | Tisa  | Include PDF & PPT links                                          |\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to:\n✔ **Generate a ready-to-share pre-read template** for the 1-pager **OR**\n✔ **Draft a Teams message/email** summarizing the plan with embedded critical links?  \n(That would save prep time immediately.)", "assertions": [{"text": "The response should state the meeting start time as July 26, 2025 at 14:00 PST, matching the scheduled Event.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Timeline", "sourceID": "0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a"}}, {"text": "The response should correctly identify Tisa Odonoghue as the meeting organizer and Nila Tanguma as the confirmed attendee.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Ownership clarity", "sourceID": "0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a"}}, {"text": "The response should specify at least five actionable tasks each with an explicit owner and due date before T₀.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Ownership clarity", "sourceID": "0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a"}}, {"text": "The response should schedule the task 'Confirm Meeting Objectives & Scope' with owner Tisa and due date on or before July 24 EOD PST.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Timeline & dependencies", "sourceID": "0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a"}}, {"text": "The response should include a dependency stating that drafting the 1-pager occurs only after consolidating open items is complete.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Dependency", "sourceID": "0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a"}}, {"text": "The response should explicitly call out assumptions because the detailed meeting agenda beyond 'action items review' is inferred and not confirmed.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Disclosure of assumptions", "sourceID": "0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a"}}, {"text": "The response should reference the file 'Vault_Secret_Management_Deep_Dive.pdf' as part of the preparation artifacts.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Artifact readiness", "sourceID": "a8b47570-5778-48bf-9d26-44fa1fe19536"}}, {"text": "The response should reference the file 'FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx' in the prep tasks or pre-read list.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Artifact readiness", "sourceID": "3610a1f7-56aa-40de-8551-e038d5dff5d2"}}, {"text": "The response should allocate a final review buffer on July 26 at least 5 hours before T₀.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Timeline & buffers", "sourceID": "0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a"}}, {"text": "The response should propose sending a pre-read at least 2 hours before T₀ including links to key security and compliance docs.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Artifact readiness", "sourceID": "a5996112-bc82-4a70-a2ed-85cf4f91a28a"}}, {"text": "The response should not include attendees beyond Nila since only one attendee is confirmed in the Event.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Participant accuracy", "sourceID": "0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a"}}, {"text": "The response should acknowledge the tight timeline of approximately 2.5 days and reflect urgency in task scheduling.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Timeline feasibility", "sourceID": "0788e132-56ad-45de-a531-4553a88af64a"}}]}

Includes dependencies and owners where evident.)*\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 1: Final Day Coordination (Meeting Day: Jul 27)**  \n**Task:**  \n- **Conduct 1:1 Deep Dive**  \n    - **Due:** Jul 27 @ 17:00 PDT  \n    - **Owner:** Danille & Emory  \n    - **Notes:** Focus on resource tuning decisions, confirm HPA Jenkins integration snippet contents, finalize validation run plan.\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 2: Pre-Meeting Finalization (Jul 27 Morning)**  \n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Dry-run HPA validation script (simulate minReplicas/maxReplicas scaling) | Jul 27 10:00 | Emory | Use staging cluster. Emit Prometheus metrics for latency; verify Chaos Monkey pods autoscale correctly. |\n| Prepare talking points & embed snippet excerpts into Teams agenda | Jul 27 12:00 | Danille | Pull Groovy snippet from shared Jenkins library draft and YAML snippet from `Chaos_Resource_Autoscaling_Guide.docx`. Add to pre-read deck for easy screen share. |\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 3: Pre-Read Distribution & Jenkins Snippet Drafting (Jul 26)**  \n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Finalize Jenkins pipeline snippet for HPA integration | **Jul 26 EOD** | Danille | Base on agenda #3: include MAX_PARALLEL_CHAOS_PODS as reference pattern from `QA_Playbook_Chaos_Section.docx`; inject HPA params via env mapping. |\n| Validate `Chaos_Resource_Autoscaling_Guide.docx` alignment | Jul 26 | Emory | Highlight target CPU utilization=50%, check 600m/512Mi resource constraints, YAML metrics block correctness. |\n| Distribute pre-read (Guide + snippet screenshot) via email/Teams | Jul 26 | Danille | Use attachment link from EngineeringDocuments; confirm Emory has access. |\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 4: Early Prep & Infra Checkpoints (Jul 25)**  \n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Confirm cluster readiness for HPA tests | **Jul 25 PM** | Emory | Ensure metrics-server running, Prometheus scrape configs include HPA metrics, RBAC roles in place for autoscaler. |\n| Draft deck skeleton for deep dive | Jul 25 | Danille | One-slide overview of current autoscaling gaps, one for Jenkins pipeline flow diagram. Use style from `Compliance_Enforcement_DeepDive.pptx` and `FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx` as reference. |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Dependencies & Risk Mitigation**\n- Jenkins snippet completion (**Danille**) → prerequisite for dry-run & meeting discussion.\n- Prometheus connectivity for autoscaler metrics → flagged as high-risk; buffer half-day (Jul 25) for fixes.\n- Book 30-min buffer before meeting for last-minute alignment in case HPA script fails scaling simulation.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Assumptions**\n- Meeting slot (Jul 27 @17:00 PDT) stays fixed. *(If rescheduled, this workback must shift accordingly.)*  \n- Current user (Emory) has Kubernetes cluster + Jenkins pipeline access.  \n- No major resource constraints on staging cluster over the weekend (Jul 26–27).  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Summary View**\n**Jul 25 (Fri):** Infra readiness check + draft deep dive slides  \n**Jul 26 (Sat):** Jenkins HPA snippet finalized, validate guide, distribute pre-read  \n**Jul 27 (Sun):** Dry-run validation AM → Meeting prep mid-day → Deep Dive @17:00  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **auto-generate a shareable checklist (Markdown or Excel)** for this timeline **or draft the Jenkins snippet skeleton** (`parameters {...}` + `kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml`) based on our pipeline pattern?", "assertions": [{"text": "The response should state that the meeting '1:1 Deep Dive: Resource Autoscaling & HPA Jenkins Integration' is scheduled for July 27, 2025 at 17:00–18:00 PDT as confirmed by the event details.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Meeting Objective & Scope", "sourceID": "1370f9b9-70e4-4760-b963-e7528b2c2d6e"}}, {"text": "The response should include agenda items on CPU/memory request adjustments, HPA YAML validation, and Jenkins pipeline snippet integration aligning with the meeting description.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Meeting Objective & Scope", "sourceID": "1370f9b9-70e4-4760-b963-e7528b2c2d6e"}}, {"text": "The response should specify that 'Confirm cluster readiness for HPA tests' is scheduled for July 25 and assign the owner as Emory.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Ownership clarity", "sourceID": "1370f9b9-70e4-4760-b963-e7528b2c2d6e"}}, {"text": "The response should include the task 'Draft deck skeleton for deep dive' on July 25 and assign the owner as Danille.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Ownership clarity", "sourceID": "1370f9b9-70e4-4760-b963-e7528b2c2d6e"}}, {"text": "The response should schedule 'Finalize Jenkins pipeline snippet for HPA integration' on July 26 and assign Danille as the owner.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Dependencies & sequencing", "sourceID": "1370f9b9-70e4-4760-b963-e7528b2c2d6e"}}, {"text": "The response should state that the dry-run HPA validation script is due July 27 at 10:00 PDT and assigned to Emory.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Timeline & Buffers", "sourceID": "1370f9b9-70e4-4760-b963-e7528b2c2d6e"}}, {"text": "The response should explicitly link the pre-read material 'Chaos_Resource_Autoscaling_Guide.docx' and schedule its distribution on July 26.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Artifact readiness", "sourceID": "02e54c5c-e705-45af-b89e-7501a403a0e4"}}, {"text": "The response should include at least one buffer period before the meeting (e.g., a 30-minute buffer) for risk mitigation as mentioned.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Timeline & Buffers", "sourceID": "1370f9b9-70e4-4760-b963-e7528b2c2d6e"}}, {"text": "The response should disclose assumptions explicitly, such as the meeting slot remaining fixed and Emory having Kubernetes cluster access.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Disclosure of missing info and assumptions", "sourceID": "1370f9b9-70e4-4760-b963-e7528b2c2d6e"}}, {"text": "The response should reference stylistic guidance for the deck by citing 'Compliance_Enforcement_DeepDive.pptx' or 'FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx' as used in the output.", "level": "aspirational", "anchors": {"Dim": "Artifact readiness", "sourceID": "20f869f9-cb03-45f3-8740-3728d5dad6d2"}}]}

Review P99 expressions for `migration_duration_seconds` and `rollback_duration_seconds` histograms  \n  2. Threshold color overrides for P99 (e.g., red >3s) and legend formatting  \n  3. Validate JSON model changes in `dashboard/migration_rollback.json` (lines 20–40)  \n  4. Plan timeline and reviewer assignment for EngineeringDocuments PR  \n- **Meeting Type:** Online (Teams)\n\n**Time available:** ≈16 hours from now → extremely tight; all prep must finish by midday UTC to allow breathing room before meeting.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Related Information\n- No direct file attachment for dashboard JSON, but related engineering file exists:  \n  `Optimization_Workshop_Planning_Document.docx` (covers performance tuning topics, so conceptual overlaps exist but not critical for this calibration meeting).\n- Since dashboard JSON is explicitly referenced, assume it’s in your code repository under `dashboard/migration_rollback.json`.\n\n---\n\n## 🗂 Key Assumptions\n- Meeting locked at 16:00 UTC today.  \n- No external dependencies except your and Era’s availability.  \n- Code updates and context are in Git repo; you and Era can access them.  \n- This is a tactical, short calibration sync, not a multi-day project.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workback Timeline (Starting from meeting time and working backward)\n\n### **Phase 1: Final Sync Before Meeting**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Finalize pre-read summary (key P99 formula changes, threshold note) and share on Teams chat | **14:30 UTC** (90 min before) | Shakia | Use agenda bullets + screenshot of current dashboard JSON segment; reduces meeting cold-start risk |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Validate and Stage Technical Content**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Pull latest `dashboard/migration_rollback.json` and verify panel JSON lines 20–40 (ensure expressions and color thresholds as per goal) | **13:30 UTC** | Era | Check variables for repeat support; confirm overrides for P99 lines |\n| Confirm threshold color mappings (e.g., P99 >3s = red) implemented correctly in JSON | **13:45 UTC** | Shakia | Cross-check with internal standard for high-latency visual alerts |\n| Draft pull request skeleton for EngineeringDocuments plan (you’ll finalize after meeting, but prep title/labels) | **14:00 UTC** | Shakia | Goal: reduce post-meeting turnaround |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Prep Collaborative Inputs**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Draft quick “Reviewer matrix” for dashboard JSON PR to discuss in meeting | **12:30 UTC** | Shakia | Identify who may review post-meeting—likely dashboard maintainers |\n| Ping Era in Teams to confirm readiness and share quick context note | **12:00 UTC** | Shakia | Include code link, ask if any blockers |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Early-Morning Kickoff / Set Workspace**\n| Task | Due | Owner | Notes |\n|------|-----|-------|-------|\n| Open current Grafana dashboard and snapshot P99 graphs for reference in meeting | **11:30 UTC** | Era | Screenshots will support calibration discussion |\n| Reserve 30-min pre-meeting block in calendar for self-review & context alignment | **09:00 UTC** | Shakia | Just a personal prep slot |\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Risk & Mitigations\n- **Tight window** (16 hrs including sleeping hours): front-load prep early morning UTC; flag if Era is in different time zone.  \n- If JSON changes need repo access and network lag occurs, drop PR skeleton and instead queue for after meeting.  \n- No time for full dry run—focus on correct snapshot and expressions validation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nYou have a **compressed timeline—about 4–5 working hours once your day starts**. This plan prioritizes JSON validation → context sharing → pre-read summary → alignment on reviewers. Meeting should then flow with zero surprises.\n\n---\n\n#### ✅ Next Steps for You Right Now:\n1. Block 09:00–11:30 UTC for prep cycles.\n2. Ping Era in Teams early to confirm her morning availability.\n3. Pull JSON changes and schedule quick 30-min internal validation before noon UTC.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a Teams message template** to share with Era summarizing her pre-meeting tasks and the context link?

Meeting Details (Extracted from Grounding Data)\n- **Meeting Title:** One-on-One: Grafana Dashboard & Alert Tuning Deep Dive  \n- **Scheduled Date & Time:** **2025-07-24, 16:00–16:30 UTC**  \n- **Location:** Microsoft Teams (link: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/dashboard-tuning`)  \n- **Organizer:** Shari Jatho (Solutions Architect)  \n- **Required Attendees:**  \n  - Shari Jatho (`lod_sharij`)  \n  - Emory Scherping (`lod_emorys`) *(you are an attendee)*  \n- **Agenda (from event body):**  \n  1. Review current Grafana panel JSON and threshold color mappings (file: `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`).  \n  2. Discuss legend formatting and cache_size grouping.  \n  3. Iterate on PromQL alert expressions for thrash warnings and resize invocations.  \n  4. Plan demo screens & walkthrough for Monday’s stand-up.  \n  5. Identify missing metrics/panel adjustments.  \n- **Attachments:** *(None provided explicitly; but reference file mentioned in agenda: `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`.)*  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ 2. Time Window & Constraints\n- **Current Time:** 2025-07-22T00:00:00+08:00 → effectively **July 21, 16:00 UTC**.  \n- **Time to Meeting:** ~**3 days**.  \n- **Priority:** High → compressed timeline, tasks must be clearly staged with short turnarounds.  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ 3. Preparation Milestones (Based on Agenda & Dependencies)\n\nBelow is the **Workback Plan**, starting from meeting day and working backward:\n\n#### **Phase 1: Final Confirmation (Day of Meeting)**\n| # | Task | Due Date (UTC) | Owner | Notes |\n|---|------|----------------|-------|-------|\n| 1 | Join One-on-One Meeting | 2025-07-24 16:00 | Emory | Teams link provided in invite. |\n| 2 | Have updated Grafana dashboard JSON & PromQL alerts ready to share | 2025-07-24 14:00 | Emory/Shari | Any edits must be finalized. |\n\n#### **Phase 2: Dry Run & Material Lock (T‑1 Day)**\n| # | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|---|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 3 | Perform quick **walkthrough of dashboard changes + alert simulations** | 2025-07-23 16:00 | Emory | Confirm no color mapping misalignments; validate alert firing using sample Prometheus range. |\n| 4 | Send **updated panel JSON and PromQL snippets** to Shari via Teams chat | 2025-07-23 14:00 | Emory | Include legend grouping updates and threshold mapping changes. |\n| 5 | Validate **Teams link and meeting time** | 2025-07-23 13:00 | Emory | Cross-check calendar invite and ensure no conflicts. |\n\n#### **Phase 3: Prep & Stakeholder Input (T‑2 Days)**\n| # | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|---|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 6 | Collect **latest dashboard JSON** (`jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json`) and clone to safe branch for edits | 2025-07-22 18:00 | Emory | Pull from Git repo or shared doc location. |\n| 7 | Draft **revised Grafana panel configurations** | 2025-07-22 20:00 | Emory | Apply agreed legend reformatting and grouping by `cache_size`. |\n| 8 | Draft initial **alerting PromQL expressions** for: ① thrash warnings, ② resize invocations | 2025-07-22 21:00 | Emory | Base metrics: `jwt_cache_thrash` and `ci_cache_resize_invocations`. |\n| 9 | Share early draft in Teams DM with Shari for ✏️ feedback | 2025-07-22 22:00 | Emory | Request +1 day feedback cycle, async review. |\n\n#### **Phase 4: Alignment Kickoff (Today)**\n| # | Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|---|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 10 | Confirm agenda and deliverables with Shari (from event invite) | 2025-07-22 10:00 | Emory | Ensure expectations for stand-up demo content are aligned. |\n| 11 | Check if any **stand-up demo assets** or screenshots are already in progress | 2025-07-22 12:00 | Emory | If not, include this in tomorrow’s dry run plan. |\n\n### ✅ 4. Additional Notes / Assumptions\n- All dates assume **UTC time zone** per meeting invite.  \n- **Dependencies:** JSON edits depend on locating the file; alert rules depend on confirming correct Prometheus labels & metrics in staging.  \n- Meeting objective includes **creating demo screens for Monday’s stand-up** → ensure screenshots/workflow notes are part of dry run.  \n- If any required dataset or query examples are missing from docs, surface blockers to Shari within 24 hours to avoid delays.  \n\n### ✅ 5. Quick Risk Flags\n- **Tight timeline:** Only 2 prep days before final dry run; minimize iteration cycles — async feedback is critical.  \n- **Technical dependencies:** Access to staging Grafana + Prometheus queries must be verified today.  \n- **Action:** If file `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json` is not readily available, request Shari’s copy immediately.  \n\n✅ Do you want me to **also provide a ready-to-use Teams message template to send Shari summarizing this prep plan**?

Identify missing metrics or panel adjustments  \n- **Attachments Provided:** *None explicitly attached to event*, but reference to file: `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json` (dashboard config)  \n- Related responsibilities based on agenda: Pre-read JSON review, PromQL tuning, dashboard modification, alert testing  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 2: Time Remaining & Constraints\n\n- **Meeting in ~7 calendar days**  \n- Tasks like PromQL queries, Grafana dashboard JSON edits, alert rule validation, and demo prep should finish at least 1–2 business days before.\n- Monday stand-up mention suggests **July 21 (Mon)** is a relevant intermediate checkpoint (demo dry run alignment).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 3: High-Level Workback Phases\n\n- **Phase A (July 18–19): Prep & Analysis**\n- **Phase B (July 20–22): Alignment & Refinement**\n- **Phase C (July 23): Final Dry Run & Logistics**\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 4: Detailed Workback Plan (Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes)\n\n| Task                                                                                           | Due Date        | Owner         | Notes / Dependencies                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Confirm file access & pre-read availability**: Ensure `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json` or related Grafana JSON config is accessible. | **Jul 18 (Fri)** | Emory        | Critical first step; needed for reviewing threshold colors & legend setup |\n| **Draft proposed alert tuning plan**: Document current PromQL queries for jwt thrash & CI cache resize; list gaps | **Jul 19 (Sat)** | Emory        | Use historical Prometheus metrics for evaluation if possible |\n| **Share initial observations with Shari via chat/email** | **Jul 19 (Sat) EOD** | Emory | Stakeholder sync to validate direction early |\n| **Prepare revised dashboard JSON mockups**: Include threshold color tweaks & legend grouping changes | **Jul 20 (Sun)** | Emory | Build on review outcome; store in shared repo or send screenshot |\n| **Align on PromQL expression modifications**: Confirm alert rules (warn vs critical) & grouping by labels | **Jul 21 (Mon)** | Emory + Shari | Tie-in with upcoming Monday stand-up; ensure both sign-off |\n| **Conduct quick metrics validation in staging Grafana**: Test new PromQL queries with simulated cache thrash | **Jul 21 (Mon)** | Emory | Depends on Prometheus data & alertmanager config access |\n| **Incorporate feedback & lock final configs (JSON + PromQL)** | **Jul 22 (Tue)** | Emory | Post in Teams for confirmation |\n| **Prepare annotated screenshots & short demo script**: Highlight new thresholds & alert firing conditions | **Jul 23 (Wed)** | Emory | Will be used for the actual 1:1 deep dive session |\n| **Check Teams meeting link & screen share setup** | **Jul 23 (Wed) PM** | Emory | Confirm permissions; reduce risk of tech failure |\n| **Final readiness check**: Ensure dashboards updated in staging, alerts visible & firing in test state | **Jul 24 (Thu) AM** | Emory | Last-mile QA before meeting at 16:00 UTC |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Dependencies & Risk Notes\n- Access to Grafana & Alertmanager is assumed; if blocked, escalate by Jul 18.\n- PromQL edit validation in staging should not break existing production alerts; use temporary alert rules if needed.\n- Monday’s stand-up (Jul 21) serves as soft checkpoint; feedback on design guides final tuning.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Assumptions\n- jwt_cache_thrash/ci_cache_resize metrics & dashboard JSON are in a shared Git repo or available through Grafana UI export.\n- Prometheus and alertmanager configs can be tested in staging without approval bottlenecks.\n- No additional stakeholders need to review beyond Shari.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Recommended Next Step:\n**Immediately**: Confirm access to `jwt_cache_thrash_alerts_dashboard.json` and prep current Grafana panel details for review.

Distribute final agenda & deck to attendees | **July 24 (EOD UTC)** | Rufina Ganie | Attach deck link in Teams meeting chat + email |\n| Confirm Teams meeting link active & screen-share permissions verified | **July 24** | Emory Scherping | Double-check with IT if link requires refresh |\n| Dry run (optional but recommended) | **July 24 (AM UTC)** | Shakia + Era + Emory | Quick sync to ensure flows and transitions are clear |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Core Preparation Work**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Pull latest JWT cache thrash metrics & alert config snapshots | **July 23** | Emory Scherping | Export Prometheus panels or Grafana screenshots for inclusion in deck |\n| Compile forced eviction integration test report (CI data) | **July 23** | Era Manteca | Verify data covers pass/fail rates & any flakiness patterns |\n| Merge any pending metric instrumentation PRs into `develop` branch & log tracking IDs | **July 22** | Rufina Ganie (you) | Ensure code state matches assumptions for analysis |\n| Validate aggregated p50/p95 latency and compare pre/post optimization stats | **July 22** | Emory Scherping | Use staging run logs and Micrometer/PromQL queries |\n| Draft early version of slide deck `JwtCache_Metrics_DeepDive_Slides.pptx` | **July 21** | Shakia Gencarelli | Include placeholders for charts and analysis tables

statements | **July 20** | Rufina Ganie | Use Teams chat or shared doc for feedback |\n| Confirm agenda alignment & objectives with organizer | **July 19** | Rufina Ganie | Quick check-in with Shakia to validate scope |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Today + Immediate Actions**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Kick off prep sync thread in Teams with all attendees | **July 18 (today)** | Rufina Ganie | Drop message summarizing timeline and responsibilities |\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Dependencies & Risk Mitigation\n- **Dependencies:** Deck finalization depends on Emory & Era delivering metrics and CI test data by July 23.  \n- **Risks:** Metrics gathering could be delayed if PromQL queries fail → Have Emory schedule queries overnight from July 21 to allow buffer.  \n- **Buffer:** 1 day buffer before meeting (July 24) for consolidation and rehearsal.  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Success Criteria Before Meeting\n✔ Deck is up-to-date with accurate metrics and CI pass rate tables.  \n✔ All attendees have pre-read materials by EOD July 24.  \n✔ Teams link and recording permissions have been tested.  \n✔ Everyone is aligned on discussion points (no surprises).  \n\n---\n\n### Why this is Practical:\n- You have 6 working days → Plan spreads tasks logically with a reserved day for final checks.  \n- Responsibilities match attendee expertise from grounding data (Emory for metrics, Era for CI, you for alignment & PR merges).  \n\n---\n\n👉 **Next Step for You (Rufina):** Post kickoff message today summarizing above timeline in Teams chat and start aligning data owners.  \n\n---\n\n✅ **Do you want me to also generate a Teams-ready message that summarizes this workback plan for your project group chat?**", "assertions": [{"text": "The response should

Include latency, hit ratio, eviction rate panels. |\n| **Complete pipeline integration tests for JWT cache** | **July 25 (Fri)** | Era & Rufina | Validate CI/CD behaves correctly under new cache resizing params. Regression checks + security impact (JWT validation). Share logs. |\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation & Review Phase (D-4 to D-6)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Draft meeting agenda & circulate for quick approval** | **July 23 (Wed)** | Shakia | Base on event description but add time splits, Q&A, action items. |\n| **Aggregate latest cache performance metrics & test results** | **July 23 (Wed)** | Emory | Pull data from staging tests/logs. Summarize in markdown and upload to Teams/SharePoint folder for visibility. |\n| **Collect stakeholder input on parameter boundaries** | **July 24 (Thu)** | Emory (with Markita & Rufina) | Confirm safe ranges for min/max cache size, eviction policy tails, and alert thresholds. Validate with both DevOps and app team. |\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Prep (Now – D-7 to D-5)**  \n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Identify reference materials & dependencies** | **July 21 (Mon)** | Emory | Include any prior outcomes from Feature Flag infra sessions if relevant for sizing heuristics. Example sources: `FeatureFlagProdRollout_Plan.docx`, `ShardTestStrategy.xlsx`. |\n| **Verify metrics instrumentation & logging hooks in code repositories** | **July 22 (Tue)** | Era | Validate tags for Prometheus exporters reflect cache changes and are aligned with dashboard expectations. |\n| **Security check for JWT cache parameter updates** | **July 22 (Tue)** | Markita | Ensure no leaks, confirm TLS contexts if Redis/memory backing store touched. |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Additional Recommendations\n- Instead of creating an entire new deck, reuse **ShardTestStrategy.xlsx** and metrics snippets if applicable; this accelerates prep.  \n- Use **Teams feature-flag-infra channel** for async sign-offs (as clashing calendars might delay approvals).  \n- If anyone is PTO late in the week, front-load data gathering (risk mitigation).  \n\n---\n\n## 🔍 **Summary of Critical Deadlines**\n- **D-6 (July 21):** Materials identified, environment validation kicks off  \n- **D-5/D-4 (July 22–23):** Metrics hooks audited, agenda drafted, initial data aggregated  \n- **D-3/D-2 (July 24–25):** Input collection, dashboard finalization, CI/CD integration verified  \n- **D-1 (July 26):** Pre-read pack shared, dry run completed  \n\n---\n\n✅ **This plan is achievable within 7 days if tasks start tomorrow, but the timeline is tight.

Time is tight → plan needs aggressive steps.  \n- **Notes:** No specific attachments or decks currently mentioned; context suggests need for failure metrics and canary test logs.  \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Key Considerations Before Workback\n- Meeting goal: **Analyze canary results, discuss performance and error anomalies, and agree on next steps for production rollout.**\n- Attendees span Engineering, QA, DevOps → need consolidated input on:\n    - Canary run metrics (latency, error rates, log anomalies).\n    - Known rollback or incident tickets.\n- Recent context: Secure Sprint, HMAC pipeline enhancements, and telemetry schema updates → these likely influenced canary stability; summaries helpful.\n- Plan needs to **finalize agenda, gather metrics, draft summary deck, and circulate to participants before 07/24 EOD**.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Workback Plan (Starting from 2025-07-25 Meeting)\n\n### **Phase 3: Day of Meeting – 2025-07-25**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Host Post-Canary Retrospective | **07/25 08:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Check Teams link;

share via Teams/Email. |\n| Validate Teams link & attendee confirmations | **07/24 16:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Confirm Cortez, Rufina, Myles availability; update if conflicts arise. |\n| Internal dry run (optional but ideal) | **07/24 15:00 UTC** | Keren (with optional QA lead) | 15-min check to ensure key charts and rollback flows are clear. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Prep & Inputs – 2025-07-22 to 2025-07-23**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| **Draft meeting agenda** | **07/22 20:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Topics: 1) Error spikes post-canary, 2) Latency & KPIs vs targets, 3) Lessons for rollout, 4) Action items. |\n| **Collect canary performance metrics & logs** | **07/23 12:00 UTC** | Cortez Dehn | Include Prometheus latency/error rates, rollback snapshots. |\n| **QA defect & rollback summary** | **07/23 12:00 UTC** | Myles Mckoan | Ensure Jira issue IDs & status grouped by severity. |\n| **Draft summary slides (metrics + recommendations)** | **07/23 18:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Use structure seen in prior retros (see *Fraud_Anomaly_Algorithm_Optimizations* for style reference). |\n| **Send early heads-up to attendees with preliminary stats** | **07/23 19:00 UTC** | Keren Guisbert | Short note in Teams: “Here’s what we’ll cover; final deck tomorrow.” |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Assumptions & Risks\n- **Canary logs + Perf KPIs** are accessible by Engineering (Cortez) and QA (Myles).\n- No pre-read attached to event → assuming we need to create one.\n- Only 2 working days before meeting → plan is aggressive, owners must prioritize tasks.\n- If last-minute errors occur in data pull, escalate in Teams for real-time fixes.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Quick Visual Timeline\n```\n07/22 EOD → Agenda drafted\n07/23 midday → Metrics (DevOps & QA)\n07/23 evening → First draft deck\n07/24 EOD → Final deck & agenda sent\n07/25 AM UTC → Meeting\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 🔍 Why These Steps?\n- Agenda first: ensures alignment before metrics collection.\n- Early preliminary heads-up: keeps attendees engaged and ready.\n- Final pre-read by 24th: critical so stakeholders review overnight for early UTC call.\n\n---\n\n**Do you want me to:**\n✅ Draft the **agenda content** now  \n✅ Create an **outline for the retrospective deck** based on prior templates  \n✅ Prepare a **Teams message/email snippet** to send with pre-reads  \n\n*(Pick any or all — I can build them fast.)*", "assertions": [{"text": "The response should state the meeting title as 'Post-Canary Pipeline Retrospective' exactly as per the event details.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Meeting Objective & Scope", "sourceID": "52923b8c-662b-429c-8040-d36ad9dafe01"}}, {"text": "The response should include the correct meeting start time as 2025-07-25T08:00:00 UTC and clearly indicate it is online via Teams.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Meeting Objective & Scope", "sourceID": "52923b8c-662b-429c-8040-d36ad9dafe01"}}, {"text": "The response should mention all required attendees: Cortez Dehn, Rufina Ganie, and Myles Mckoan as per the event details.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Ownership clarity", "sourceID": "52923b8c-662b-429c-8040-d36ad9dafe01"}}, {"text": "The response should present at least three distinct phases with tasks backward scheduled from the meeting date and include due dates earlier than T₀.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Timeline & Buffers", "sourceID": "52923b8c-662b-429c-8040-d36ad9dafe01"}}, {"text": "The response should assign a specific owner to every listed task in the workback plan (e.g., Keren Guisbert, Cortez Dehn, Myles Mckoan).", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Ownership clarity", "sourceID": "52923b8c-662b-429c-8040-d36ad9dafe01"}}, {"text": "The response should explicitly include a task to 'Collect canary performance metrics & logs' and assign it to Cortez Dehn with a deadline before 07/24.", "level": "critical", "anchors": {"Dim": "Dependencies & Sequencing", "sourceID": "52923b8c-662b-429c-8040-d36ad9dafe01"}}, {"text": "The response should note that no pre-read deck was attached in the original event and explicitly state the assumption that one needs to be created.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Disclosure of Missing Info", "sourceID": "52923b8c-662b-429c-8040-d36ad9dafe01"}}, {"text": "The response should schedule circulation of the final pre-read and agenda by 2025-07-24 17:00 UTC to allow at least 12 hours before the meeting.", "level": "expected", "anchors": {"Dim": "Artifact Readiness", "sourceID": "52923b8c-662b-429c-8040-d36ad9dafe01"}}, {"text": "The response should clearly mention at least one assumption or risk related to the short 2-day preparation window.", "level": "aspirational", "anchors": {"Dim": "Disclosure of Missing Info", "sourceID": "52923b8c-662b-429c-8040-d36ad9dafe01"}}]}

Pull this from canary CI/CD job runs (Jenkins/Argo logs). |\n| Collect raw metrics and logs from canary environment | **July 13** | Cortez Dehn (DevOps) | Include deployment logs, alert history, rollback/retry attempts. Ensure accuracy before analysis. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Data Analysis & Initial Plan Draft (T-minus 11–8 days)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Aggregate metrics into a concise report/dashboard | **July 15** | Rufina Ganie (Engineering) | Summarize pipeline metrics, error distributions, and promotion blockers. Use shared dashboard or PDF. |\n| Draft preliminary findings & risks for review | **July 16** | Keren Guisbert | Highlight key points: success % vs SLA, key bottlenecks. Include recommendation outline for QA sign-off. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Review & Materials Finalization (T-minus 7–4 days)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| QA validation of error counts and rollback actions | **July 18** | Myles Mckoan | Ensure bug counts and rollback triggers are accurate before entering meeting deck. |\n| Prepare and format pre-read summary deck (optional) | **July 19** | Keren Guisbert | Include 3–5 slides: Objectives, metrics snapshot, error trend graphs, proposed next steps. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Distribution & Dry Run (T-minus 3–1 day)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Circulate agenda and final materials to attendees | **July 22** | Keren Guisbert | Send Teams invite update or email with pre-read link in Files/Teams channel. Add meeting link explicitly. |\n| **(Optional)** Quick sync/dry run on metric interpretations | **July 23** | Cortez + Rufina + Keren | 15-min call: align on key talking points, ensure no surprises during meeting. |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Final Prep (Meeting Day)**\n| Task | Due Date | Owner | Notes |\n|------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Validate Teams link & screen-sharing | **July 24** | Keren | Open meeting early to test. Ensure dashboards accessible if live demo planned. |\n| **Meeting: Canary Pipeline Debrief & Metrics Analysis** | **July 25, 08:00 UTC** | All | Goal: confirm readiness for prod promotion; finalize action items and owners. |\n\n---\n\n### 🛠 Assumptions & Risks\n- **Assumption:** No external vendor deliverables; all data internal (Jenkins, monitoring dashboards).\n- **Risk if delayed:** Cortez or Rufina not delivering metrics on time will compress QA and deck prep window. Mitigate by timeboxing collection and early ping by July 13.\n- **Next steps after meeting:** Likely a follow-up for promotion/go-live approval; add to backlog.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Quick Tips for Execution\n- Use **Teams chat thread** for rolling updates.\n- Store the draft and final decks in `/Engineering/Pipeline-Reviews` for traceability.\n- Tag attendees 24h before meeting to confirm attendance.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-copy visual timeline (Gantt-style) or a Teams-ready checklist with reminders**?

Plan assumes weekday work availability.  \n- Tasks must be compressed into **5 effective working days**. Compliance & performance artifacts exist from prior workshops; reuse those where relevant.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 3. Key Milestones (from agenda & related artifacts)\n- Finalize agenda / Q&A prompts  \n- Gather chaos engineering experiment outputs & dashboard snapshots  \n- Summarize security scan findings (from OWASP ZAP, Trivy)  \n- Prepare Grafana dashboard JSON export v3.0 confirmation  \n- Align dependency upgrade proposals & Jira ticket template  \n- Distribute pre-read packet to attendees  \n- Validate Teams link & AV setup for hybrid session  \n\n---\n\n## **WORKBACK PLAN**  \n*(Starting from meeting date and working backward, UTC is assumed)*\n\n### **Phase 1: Day of Meeting**\n| Date       | Task                                        | Owner             | Notes |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Jun 30 (Mon)** | **Conduct Brown-bag Q&A session** | Terina Hafen (Host) + All Attendees | Start 11:00 UTC |\n| Jun 30 08:30 | Final AV & Teams link test | Ossie Ziller | Verify LiveOak HQ room + Teams stream |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Final Prep**\n| Date       | Task                                        | Owner             | Notes |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Jun 29 (Sun)** | Buffer for any late slide/alert tweaks | Terina Hafen | Optional; low activity expected |\n| **Jun 27 (Fri) EOD** | Distribute pre-read packet (compiled chaos test summary, OWASP ZAP/Trivy highlights, Grafana JSON link) | Terina Hafen | PDF or Teams post; deadline firm |\n| Jun 27 | Confirm speaking order & Q&A flow | Terina Hafen, Sau Alquesta | Cross-check agenda |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Content Finalization**\n| Date       | Task                                               | Owner           | Notes |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| **Jun 26 (Thu)** | Collate experiment metrics & dashboard snapshots | Ashley Engel   | Pull CPU burn, latency charts from chaos run |\n| Jun 26 | Package OWASP ZAP & Trivy scan remediation summary | Keren Guisbert | Pull from CI security reports (latest runs) |\n| Jun 26 | Verify Grafana JSON export v3.0 vs staging dashboards | Jack Schrott | Ensure templating variables work |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Inputs & Draft Agenda**\n| Date       | Task                                       | Owner            | Notes |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| **Jun 25 (Wed)** | Draft & circulate agenda for feedback | Terina Hafen    | Include Q&A prompts |\n| Jun 25 | Identify next sprint upgrade candidates & draft Jira ticket template | Ossie Ziller + Sau Alquesta | Cross-reference with dependency matrix |\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 5: Kickoff & Early Logistics**\n| Date       | Task                                       | Owner             | Notes |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Jun 24 (Tue)** | Validate Teams link & room booking | Terina Hafen      | Confirm AV and channel pinned |\n| Jun 24 | Assign action item owners for content sections | Terina Hafen      | Ensure Ashley/Keren/Jack aligned |\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Timeline (Summary)**\n```\nJun 24: Logistics confirmed + Assign content owners\nJun 25: Agenda drafted + Next-sprint targets outlined\nJun 26: Collect chaos/security findings + Validate dashboards\nJun 27: Distribute pre-read packet (slides + dashboards)\nJun 29: Slack/Email reminder & buffer\nJun 30: Meeting day – Go live @11:00 UTC\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Dependencies & Risk Notes**\n- **Dependency:** Pre-read packet (Jun 27) depends on chaos metrics, ZAP/Trivy findings, and Grafana validation by Jun 26.\n- **Risk:** Tight turnaround if dashboard export v3.0 fails validation → Mitigate by validating JSON early on Jun 26.\n- **Assumption:** All attendees can access Teams channel and prior workshop outputs (no evidence suggests access issues).\n- **Owner Clarification:** Based on job roles + prior responsibilities from data:  \n  - Chaos experiment results → QA Engineer (Ashley Engel)  \n  - Security scan → Junior Eng. (Keren Guisbert)  \n  - Grafana export → DevOps Eng. (Jack Schrott)  \n  - Logistics & coordination → Terina Hafen  \n\n---\n\n✅ This plan covers: agenda, metrics, security summaries, dashboard readiness, Jira templates, pre-reads, and hybrid AV setup, all sequenced for a 7-day runway.\n\n---\n\n**Next step suggestion:**  \nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-share checklist or a Gantt-style visualization** for this workback plan so your team can track progress easily in Teams or Confluence?
