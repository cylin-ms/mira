WORKBACK PLAN ASSERTIONS - QUALITY ANALYSIS REPORT
Generated: 2025-11-28 11:33:30
================================================================================

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Quality Grade: B

Strengths:
  ✓ Comprehensive coverage of timeline, ownership, and artifact readiness aspects
  ✓ Clear differentiation between critical, expected, and aspirational levels
  ✓ Assertions are specific and actionable, often including concrete dates and names

Weaknesses:
  ✗ Dimension taxonomy is inconsistent, with duplicates and inconsistent casing
  ✗ Overemphasis on timeline-related aspects compared to risk management and communication quality
  ✗ Some critical assertions may be overly granular, reducing flexibility in evaluation

================================================================================
## IDENTIFIED PATTERNS
Total patterns: 10


### P1: Explicit Meeting Details
Level: critical
Description: Checks that the response states the correct meeting date, time, and key participants as per the official event.
Template: The response should explicitly state the meeting date, time, and attendees matching the official invite.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does the response include the correct meeting date and time?
  • Does the response list attendees without introducing uninvited participants?

### P2: Timeline Backward Planning
Level: critical
Description: Ensures the response provides a clear backward schedule from T₀ with logical sequencing and buffers.
Template: The response should include a backward timeline from the meeting start (T₀) with all preparation tasks scheduled logically and with buffer time.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does the response show tasks scheduled before T₀ in reverse order?
  • Is there at least one buffer day or reasonable time gap before the meeting?

### P3: Ownership Assignment
Level: critical
Description: Checks that every task in the plan has a clearly assigned owner.
Template: The response should assign an explicit owner for each listed task.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does every task have a named owner?
  • Are owners consistent with known roles (e.g., organizer, attendee)?

### P4: Artifact Specification
Level: expected
Description: Ensures the plan identifies required artifacts and their readiness steps.
Template: The response should specify key artifacts to be prepared or shared and include deadlines for their readiness.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does the response list specific artifacts (e.g., files, decks)?
  • Are there tasks to prepare and distribute these artifacts before T₀?

### P5: Dependency Sequencing
Level: expected
Description: Checks that tasks are logically ordered and dependencies are explicit.
Template: The response should sequence tasks logically and make critical dependencies explicit.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does the response indicate which tasks depend on others?
  • Are prerequisite tasks scheduled before dependent tasks?

### P6: Meeting Objective Clarity
Level: expected
Description: Ensures the response states the meeting purpose and scope explicitly.
Template: The response should clearly state the meeting's purpose and scope, aligned with context or assumptions.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does the response describe the meeting's purpose?
  • Is the stated purpose consistent with known context or assumptions?

### P7: Assumption Disclosure
Level: aspirational
Description: Checks that the response explicitly notes assumptions or missing information.
Template: The response should explicitly disclose assumptions or gaps in available information.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does the response include the word 'Assumption' or equivalent?
  • Are assumptions relevant and clearly tied to missing details?

### P8: Stakeholder Alignment
Level: aspirational
Description: Ensures the plan includes steps to confirm alignment with key stakeholders before T₀.
Template: The response should include tasks to confirm input or alignment from stakeholders before finalizing agenda or materials.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does the plan include stakeholder review or confirmation steps?
  • Are these steps scheduled early enough to influence the agenda?

### P9: Grounding in Provided Context
Level: critical
Description: Checks that the response does not introduce extraneous or fictitious details.
Template: The response should only include attendees, files, and topics consistent with the provided context.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does the response avoid introducing unlisted attendees?
  • Are all artifacts and topics relevant to the stated meeting?

### P10: Risk Identification
Level: aspirational
Description: Ensures the response identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies.
Template: The response should identify timeline or dependency risks and propose mitigation steps.
Evaluation Criteria:
  • Does the response mention risks related to timing or dependencies?
  • Are mitigation strategies proposed?

================================================================================
## COVERAGE GAPS
  ⚠ Quality of communication (clarity and conciseness of instructions)
  ⚠ Feasibility check (are timelines realistic given current date?)
  ⚠ Progress tracking or status indicators

================================================================================
## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

[Priority 1] Dimension Standardization
  Normalize dimension naming by merging duplicates and enforcing consistent casing
  Impact: Improves clarity, reduces redundancy, and enhances maintainability of the framework

[Priority 2] Critical Level Optimization
  Aggregate granular critical assertions into broader outcome-based requirements
  Impact: Increases flexibility and reduces unnecessary rigidity in evaluation

[Priority 3] Coverage Enhancement
  Add dimensions and assertions for risk management, stakeholder communication, and success metrics
  Impact: Ensures holistic evaluation of workback plans beyond logistics and artifacts

[Priority 4] Aspirational Enrichment
  Expand aspirational assertions to include proactive quality measures and define measurable criteria
  Impact: Encourages continuous improvement and higher standards in planning

================================================================================
## HUMAN JUDGE GUIDELINES

Priority Order: P1, P2, P3, P9, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P10

Minimum Coverage (MUST check):
  ✓ P1
  ✓ P2
  ✓ P3
  ✓ P4
  ✓ P5
  ✓ P9

Evaluation Workflow: Start by verifying factual accuracy (P1, P9), then check structural completeness (P2, P3, P4, P5), followed by clarity of purpose (P6) and transparency (P7). Finally, assess stakeholder engagement (P8) and risk management (P10) if applicable.
