The Secure Defaults and Vault Integration Guide builds on the recent changes introduced in PR #127 and #128 to illustrate an end-to-end workflow for substituting placeholder credentials with dynamic secret references in telemetry-config. The document describes how to configure the vaultSecretEngine YAML parameter to point to `vault://secret/data/ci/feature-flags#rollout-tokens` and enforce the `version:2` attribute as a mandatory field. It offers a complete example showing the correct indentation using two spaces per level, aligning with our YAML style guide, and demonstrates the automatic fallback to a secure default when the Jenkins pipeline variable DEPLOY_ENV is unset. The guide also highlights the corrected kebab-case naming convention for feature flags, such as `enable-feature-x`, and explains how these patterns are validated against our Confluence page at EngineeringDocuments/Standards/ConfigNamingConventions.To verify that secrets are retrieved correctly, the guide includes a snippet of the Jenkinsfile stage that invokes the Vault CLI to fetch the secret before rendering the final configuration. It outlines the integration test approach used in our staging environment, where the gRPC interceptor property `maxReceiveMessageSize: 1048576` is validated against a JSON Schema patch in telemetry-config-schema.json. Readers are directed to the Vault integration guide at SecurityTests/docs/VaultIntegration.md for detailed instructions on setting up the Vault KV engine and configuring access policies. The document concludes by suggesting a series of code review checkpoints—focused on indentation, naming conventions, schema validations, and secure defaults—that align with the newly added checklist section in the Configuration File Best Practices Confluence page. By following these recommendations, engineering teams can ensure that configuration artifacts remain both consistent and secure throughout the CI/CD lifecycle.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T17:05:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z","FileId":"7b7b5f96-e9c4-485d-8588-85d144fd8784","FileLocation":"files\\Config_CI_Deep_Dive_Workshop_Plan.docx","FileName":"Config_CI_Deep_Dive_Workshop_Plan.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_tisaodon","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_jasonadon","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_eramanteca","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/DevOps/Workshops","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Configuration Standards and CI/CD Integration Deep Dive Workshop PlanTable of Contents1.

IntroductionThis workshop is designed to build upon the foundational configuration standards work performed on 2025-07-23 and refined through subsequent deep dives. We will explore the integration of secure default values, Vault secret reference patterns, advanced JSON Schema features, and automated validation pipelines. Participants will gain hands-on experience with crafting schema rules, patternProperties, and integrating AJV into Jenkins for real-time feedback.2. Workshop ObjectivesThe primary objectives of the session are to: • Solidify safe defaults enforcement by extending the telemetry-config schema to include default values for key properties. • Demonstrate how to author and test patternProperties for vaultReference URIs to prevent misconfiguration. • Walk through the Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy pipeline snippet, focusing on parallel fixture tests, verbose error reporting, and Slack notification integration. • Provide guided exercises that replicate real-world scenarios, including pushing sample YML snippets with both valid and invalid vault URIs. • Establish a clear post-workshop action plan, assigning ownership for rolling out changes across additional repositories and service teams.3. Agenda OverviewThe workshop will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM PST on 2025-07-27 in Teams Meeting format. High-level agenda: • 2:00 – 2:15 PM: Opening remarks and recapitulation of prior sessions. • 2:15 – 3:00 PM: Secure Defaults deep dive: Vault KV patterns and kebab-case conventions. • 3:00 – 3:45 PM: JSON Schema patternProperties: advanced use cases and edge conditions. • 3:45 – 4:00 PM: Break. • 4:00 – 4:45 PM: Hands-on lab: AJV validate and test commands in CI pipeline with fixtures. • 4:45 – 5:00 PM: Wrap-up, Q&A, and assignment of follow-up tasks.4. Detailed Session Breakdown4.1 Secure Defaults & Vault Reference PatternsWe will begin by revisiting the Vault secret reference patterns introduced in PR #127 and #130, examining the regex ^vault://secret/data/[\\\\w/]+#[\\\\w-]+$ and its placement under the vaultReference node. Attendees will modify example auth-config snippets to practice enforcing version:2 defaults and validate them against the schema using ajv validate --strict. We will discuss the implications of object merging in patternProperties and how to scope regex tests to specific nodes, ensuring that unintentional mutations do not compromise security agreements.4.2 JSON Schema Enhancements & PatternPropertiesThis section delves into the modifications in configs/schema/telemetry-config-schema.json. We will walk through the insertion of default: 1048576 for maxReceiveMessageSize and the addition of a patternProperties block. Using the Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy parallel stage, participants will observe how invalid URIs are flagged and how fixture tests under configs/schema/fixtures provide coverage for both positive and negative cases. We will analyze sample fixture error logs to identify full data paths in verbose AJV output and refine the schema accordingly, strengthening maintainability and reducing ambiguous validation failures.4.3 AJV Pipeline Integration & Fixture TestsBuilding on section 4.2, the focus shifts to integrating AJV into a CI/CD pipeline. We will examine the complete pipeline DSL and execute a live run of the schema validation stage, demonstrating the --errors-distinct and --verbose flags. Attendees will create a minimal Jenkinsfile snippet, commit to a feature branch, and observe real-time notifications in #devops-alerts. Emphasis will be placed on reducing validation time through parallel stages, optimizing test fixture design, and leveraging Slack notifications for immediate feedback.5. Pre-Workshop Preparation and Required ArtifactsParticipants should complete the following prerequisites before the workshop begins: • Clone the telemetry-config and ci-config repositories and switch to the schema-validation branch. • Review the Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx (FileId: 9d6fb2b4-be42-4061-8b5f-3df08c2b6766) and Config_Change_Log.xlsx (FileId: 106554d5-ad9b-4972-863e-ad73a5fbd6fd). • Ensure a working Jenkins environment with the AJV CLI installed and Slack integration configured. • Validate access to configs/schema/fixtures for the JSON test suite, including valid-vaultReference.json and invalid-vaultReference.json.6. Post-Workshop Deliverables and Follow-Up ActionsAfter the session, attendees are expected to: • Merge approved schema patches into the main branch and bump the telemetry-config version. • Update the Confluence “Configuration File Best Practices” page with code examples and CI pipeline snippets. • Assign follow-up tasks in Jira: AI-132 for patternProperties review, AI-133 for Vault integration enhancements, and AI-134 for cross-service rollout. • Monitor the #devops-alerts channel for validation results and CI feedback on additional repositories.Appendix A: Reference Materials • Secure Defaults and Vault Integration Guide: https://liveoak.sharepoint.com/sites/devops/Shared%20Documents/DevOps/Guides/Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx • Schema Validation Pipeline DSL: Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy (FileId: 568a72db-7e31-46f8-957d-b41ccb9caa4e) • Infographic: Indentation_Impact.png (FileId: 6a0afa1b-4910-4672-ad27-43740439d35b) • Deep Dive Slides: Config_Schema_DeepDive_Slides.pptx (FileId: 09990c7a-8ef8-48e1-9c53-dc6a215b0784)","TimeStamp":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"c7d70ecc-9d1a-4ca0-886b-5649d9855e30","ChatType":"Group","ChatName":"DAST & Parallelization","Members":["lod_tisaodon","lod_cortezdehn","lod_saulq"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"3c31d78a-867d-4f7c-8ed3-f5feedcd2682","From":"lod_tisaodon","ContentType":"text","Content":"Hey Saul, Cortez – reviewing the DAST gating snippet, I noticed we read zap_report.json in the post { unsuccessful } block, but should also add a guard if totalCount == 0 to avoid division by zero.

The session, led by Shakia Gencarelli, centered on transforming exploratory code reviews and actionable feedback into concrete, repeatable practices. Attendees engaged with Jira tickets BUG-1785, BUG-1790, and BUG-1802, dissecting each violation and correlating them with key sections in our Engineering Style Guide.A primary area of emphasis is the enforcement of null-safety through the systematic application of @NotNull annotations on all public AuthService methods. The document outlines the rationale behind this choice and demonstrates how the updated JwtDecoderTest.java and JwtCacheLRUTest.java harness JUnit 5 AssertThrows semantics to verify fail-fast behavior under invalid inputs. Specific code snippets contrast pre- and post-refactor implementations, highlighting improvements in both readability and reliability.The review further drills into our security checklist, documenting the integration of @SecureEndpoint annotations, RS256 enforcement validation within application.yml, and the expansion of Jest tests under test/webhook/validateSignature.spec.ts for HMAC-SHA256 webhook signature coverage. Each rule is traced back to its corresponding Style Guide chapter, ensuring a clear lineage from policy to implementation. Sample Confluence templates and GitHub issue forms are referenced to illustrate how feedback is consistently tracked and triaged.Looking ahead, the document maps out next steps and stakeholder responsibilities. Readers are directed to the JWT_Cache_Integration_Test_Plan (FileId: \"30ea04c1-3f08-4469-bc11-3b09aa8c5683\") for end-to-end test harness configurations and to the EngineeringDocuments/Security/AuditGuide.md for the latest security-audit steps. By codifying these practices in a one-page reference, the team can maintain momentum and elevate overall code quality in upcoming sprints.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T10:00:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"78806cf8-ccee-4a19-8adb-30fef0ba8423","ChatType":"Group","ChatName":"jwt-cache-optimization-metrics","Members":["lod_shakiag","lod_rufinag","lod_emorys","lod_eramanteca","lod_markitas"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"1540f7e5-9851-4fe7-b770-7d2188cff19f","From":"lod_shakiag","ContentType":"text","Content":"Team, following up on our metrics instrumentation for jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total.

The session focused on reinforcing our Java style guide and integrating security best practices into the AuthService JWT cache implementation. Key artifacts reviewed included Jira tickets BUG-1785, BUG-1790, and BUG-1802. This plan captures the detailed issue analysis, corrective measures, and assigned action items with deadlines.2 Workshop Objectives and ScopeThe primary objectives of the workshop are to:- Enforce mandatory @NotNull annotations on all public method parameters within AuthService.- Standardize exception handling patterns in JwtDecoder.java and JwtCacheLRU.java per chapter 3.2 of the Engineering Style Guide.- Correct YAML test plan formatting in the pipeline stress-test document to ensure robust CI integration.Scope:The scope includes code review of existing pull requests (PR-213 and PR-216), bug submission and triage, test coverage validation, and documentation updates. The deliverables from this plan will be used to inform subsequent integration test cycles and downstream workshops.3 Detailed Review of Identified Issues3.1 Missing @NotNull AnnotationsDuring the session, participants discovered several public methods in AuthService lacked @NotNull annotations, exposing potential null pointer exceptions. Shakia demonstrated how to annotate method signatures and update JUnit 5 tests to assert fail-fast when null inputs are provided. Example:public String decodeToken(@NotNull String jwt) { ... }Test coverage was expanded in JwtDecoderTest.java to include null input guards.3.2 Exception Handling RefinementAnalysis of JwtDecoder.java revealed overly permissive exception handling blocks. The recommended pattern is to catch specific exceptions and rethrow as domain errors with clear messaging:try {  ...} catch (MalformedJwtException e) {  throw new JwtProcessingException(\"Invalid JWT format\", e);}This approach was codified in a custom exception strategy and documented under Style Guide chapter 3.2.3.3 YAML Pipeline Test Plan CorrectionsThe pipeline stress-test document contained improperly formatted multi-line YAML blocks, causing CI failures. Specific corrections include:- Using literal block scalars (|) for secret value definitions.- Escaping special characters in regex patterns.- Aligning indentation to two spaces per level.A corrected snippet was live-edited and validated against yaml.safe_load tests in test/webhook/validateSignature.spec.ts.4 Action Items, Ownership, and TimelinesAll attendees have committed to the following tasks:- Rufina Ganie (rufinag): Finalize the regex strip patch for yaml.safe_load errors, file BUG-1805, and create at least two unit tests for multiline secrets by end of day July 23, 2025.- Emory Scherping (emorys): Develop an integration test for the forced eviction path in JwtCacheLRU.java, verifying integer overflow guards and @NotNull enforcement. Aim for 95% Jenkins pass rate by July 25, 2025.- Era Manteca (eramanteca): Update EngineeringDocuments/Security/AuditGuide.md with the @SecureEndpoint checklist, RS256 enforcement YAML snippet, and new Jest test patterns by COB July 22, 2025.- Markita Sitra (markitas): Prepare a 5-minute demo of JwtCacheMetrics.java refactoring (thrash warning counters & eviction thresholds) for the July 23, 2025 10:00 PST stand-up. Share the recording link in #standup channel.5 Appendix: Resources and References- Jira tickets: BUG-1785, BUG-1790, BUG-1802, BUG-1805- Pull requests: PR-213 (Dynamic Cache Resizing), PR-216 (CVE-2025-3210 Hotfix)- Google Doc: Live issue tracker for follow-up tasks- Confluence: Bug report template with reproduction steps and severity ratings- Repositories: AuthService codebase on GitHub, test/webhook/validateSignature.spec.ts","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T09:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-23T09:30:00Z","FileId":"ff2ad292-bf64-473d-a239-3c9d537b029c","FileLocation":"files\\JWT_Cache_Optimization_Workshop_Outcomes.pptx","FileName":"JWT_Cache_Optimization_Workshop_Outcomes.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-23T09:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_rufinag","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_eramanteca","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_markitas","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Slides","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title• JWT Cache Optimization Workshop Outcomes• Presented by: Shakia Gencarelli, July 23, 2025Slide 2: Recap of Session• Date: July 22, 2025 at 14:30 UTC in #jwt-cache-optimizations channel• Participants: shakiag, rufinag, eramanteca, emorys, markitas• Objectives: enforce Java style guide, integrate security best practices, generate actionable bug reportsSlide 3: Key Metrics & Outcomes• Jira Tickets Reviewed: BUG-1785, BUG-1790, BUG-1802• New Ticket Filed: BUG-1805 for regex strip patch• Pull Requests Reviewed: PR-213, PR-216; 5 inline comments applied[Infographic: Bar chart comparing tickets triaged vs created vs resolved]Slide 4: Security Checklist Compliance• @NotNull annotations coverage: Pre-session 55% → Post-session 92%• @SecureEndpoint applied to 100% of public AuthService methods[Infographic: Gauge chart showing 92% annotation compliance]• Details in JWT_Cache_Security_Implementation_Roadmap.docx (FileId:54f264f9-c98e-4a42-80d1-f7614d06a240)Slide 5: Integration Test Pass Rates• Forced Eviction Test Pass Rate: 98.7% (target >95%)• Vault Readiness Flakiness: <1% after adding waitUntil probe• See JWT_Cache_Integration_Test_Plan.docx (FileId:30ea04c1-3f08-4469-bc11-3b09aa8c5683)Slide 6: Performance Benchmarks• Warm-cache P95 Latency: 1.4 ms; Cold-cache P95: 4.7 ms• Thrash Warning Events: 3 spikes / 10 min window[Infographic: Line chart of P95 latency over iteration count]• Full metrics: jwt_cache_perf_results.csv (FileId:338aff1e-684a-4cae-9dc0-116ce746224f) and JwtCache_Metrics_DeepDive_Slides.pptx (FileId:efee9dae-7a87-4f34-8761-f5d13e7295d8)Slide 7: Action Items & Next Steps• Rufina Ganie (rufinag): File BUG-1805 and finalize regex strip tests by COB Jul 23• Emory Scherping (emorys): Enhance integration tests for overflow guards by Jul 25• Era Manteca (eramanteca): Update Security/AuditGuide.md by COB Jul 22• Markita Sitra (markitas): Prepare stand-up demo slides for Jul 23 10:00 PST• See detailed roadmap in JWT_Cache_Security_Implementation_Roadmap.docx (FileId:54f264f9-c98e-4a42-80d1-f7614d06a240)Slide 8: Access & Resources• Workshop Plan: JWT_Cache_Optimization_Workshop_Plan.docx (FileId:4de41684-a33d-45e2-8472-6320eb87f0cc)• Integration Test Plan: JWT_Cache_Integration_Test_Plan.docx (FileId:30ea04c1-3f08-4469-bc11-3b09aa8c5683)• Metrics Deep Dive Slides: JwtCache_Metrics_DeepDive_Slides.pptx (FileId:efee9dae-7a87-4f34-8761-f5d13e7295d8)• Security Roadmap: JWT_Cache_Security_Implementation_Roadmap.docx (FileId:54f264f9-c98e-4a42-80d1-f7614d06a240)• Performance CSV: jwt_cache_perf_results.csv (FileId:338aff1e-684a-4cae-9dc0-116ce746224f)Slide 9: Thank You & Q&A• Questions or feedback?

The primary goal of this document is to capture the integration points between Jenkins, Snyk, Filebeat, Logstash, and Prometheus, and to articulate the design decisions that enable reliable scanning, reporting, and alerting.The first phase of the integration centers on the injection of the Snyk scan step into our Jenkins pipeline. Within the Post-Test-Gates stage, we invoke the shared security-scans library by calling runSnyk() immediately after compilation and unit testing. This approach ensures that vulnerability assessments occur before any artifacts are promoted. We leverage a withCredentials block to retrieve the SNYK_TOKEN secret, and the pipeline is configured to execute npm run build && mvn test && snyk test. By capturing the JSON output to stdout, we maintain a consistent invocation pattern that can be parsed downstream.Once the scan completes, the Go snippet developed by Emory Scherping captures the native Snyk JSON response and emits it as a series of structured log entries. This output is consumed by Filebeat’s multiline JSON parser, which aggregates the payload into coherent events. Our logstash.telemetry.conf, authored by Markita Sitra, applies a mutate filter that maps the exit code to @metadata.scan_status and extracts key metrics—such as the counts of medium, high, and critical vulnerabilities—into discrete fields. The use of metadata parsing ensures that we can replay and replay events without altering the underlying JSON structure.From Logstash, we forward enriched events to two distinct destinations: an artifact store and a Prometheus PushGateway. The artifact store retains a full Snyk report under builds/${BUILD_ID}/security/secure-scan-report.json for audit purposes, while the PushGateway accepts two metrics: security_scan_pass and security_scan_fail. We label each metric with build_id, commit_hash, and scan_status. This design enables Grafana dashboards to visualize failure rates over time and correlate build health with vulnerability trends. Additionally, alert rules in Prometheus trigger when we detect a new high or critical severity finding, enforcing immediate investigation protocols.To support compliance and policy tuning, we introduced a configurable threshold module that references our Confluence schema contract. Terina Hafen’s proposal to raise the critical severity block from zero to one is implemented via a policy file mutation step that precedes the Snyk invocation. This allows us to adjust thresholds without modifying the Jenkinsfile itself, reducing merge conflicts and centralizing policy management.Looking forward, the next phase will be to instrument downstream dashboards with anomaly detection on vulnerability incidence, and to extend our Filebeat-Logstash pipeline to capture remediation actions. We will also explore exporting Snyk scan trends to our central data warehouse for long-term analytics. By codifying each stage of this architecture, we ensure that security scanning remains a transparent, auditable, and continuous component of our CI/CD process.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-19T11:15:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-29T08:30:00Z","FileId":"487ec5c1-c3eb-4544-a02d-1d5c435e6da6","FileLocation":"files\\JWT_Cache_Thrash_Prevention_Guide.docx","FileName":"JWT_Cache_Thrash_Prevention_Guide.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-29T08:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/Architecture","DestinationType":"site","Content":"This document examines the strategies employed to prevent rapid oscillation, or \"thrash\", in the dynamic resizing mechanism of our JSON Web Token LRU cache. As our platform responds to varying load conditions, it is critical to ensure that capacity adjustments do not introduce instability. Thrash prevention is achieved by enforcing a configurable cooldown period between resize operations and by monitoring resize events to warn when thresholds are exceeded.In a dynamic resizing model, the cache adapts its capacity in response to miss-rate and CPU utilization metrics. When the miss-rate exceeds the defined threshold over the evaluation window, the cache increases its size by the up_size parameter. Similarly, when CPU usage climbs above its threshold and the hit-rate remains high, the cache decreases in size. Without proper controls, these adjustments can oscillate rapidly, leading to cache thrashing and unpredictable performance.To mitigate this risk, the cache_settings.yaml schema includes a cooldown_period property that defines the minimum interval between successive resize actions. This period is measured from the timestamp of the last applied resize event. During this interval, further resize triggers are ignored, and any attempts to adjust the cache size increment a thrash warning counter. By capturing these events in jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, we gain visibility into how often resize requests are suppressed.The CacheResizerService in the authentication microservice implements this logic. After fetching metrics from Prometheus via the metrics client, it evaluates conditions such as:    long elapsed = now - lastResizeTime;    if (missRate > config.getMissThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize + config.getUpSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else if (cpuUtil > config.getCpuThreshold() && hitRate > config.getHitThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize - config.getDownSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else {        thrashWarningsCounter.increment();    }This approach ensures that cache size adjustments occur no more frequently than configured, and that any suppressed triggers are accounted for. The updateCapacity method performs boundary checks against minCapacity and maxCapacity before applying changes.On the monitoring side, we introduce a Prometheus recording rule that accumulates jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, and a Grafana panel that overlays the warning counter with jwt_cache_current_size. This correlation allows engineers to quickly identify periods where the cache reached its cooldown limit. An alert can be configured to fire when thrash warnings increment multiple times within a short timeframe, indicating that operational thresholds may need tuning.Finally, we integrate thrash regression tests into our CI pipeline. The test suite simulates continuous miss-rate spikes and verifies that no more than one resize event occurs per cooldown period. This is achieved by injecting mock metrics and advancing the internal clock within the CacheResizerService. Any deviation from expected behavior fails the build, providing immediate feedback.In production, runbook procedures include instructions to inspect the thrash warning metrics and to adjust cooldown settings if necessary. By combining configuration controls, robust implementation, and comprehensive monitoring, we ensure that dynamic resizing enhances cache efficiency without sacrificing system stability.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-29T08:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-27T10:30:00Z","FileId":"a817d9f1-543d-4395-bcd1-b54364cf9701","FileLocation":"files\\SecureSprint_Security_Telemetry_Workflow.pdf","FileName":"SecureSprint_Security_Telemetry_Workflow.pdf","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-27T10:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_markitas","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_kerenguisbert","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_ashleyengel","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/ArchitecturalDiagrams","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Document Title: Secure Sprint 2025 DevSecOps Security & Telemetry WorkflowIntroduction:This image-heavy document delivers a comprehensive visual guide to the end-to-end Snyk integration, telemetry ingestion, and policy enforcement workflows executed during our DevSecOps Secure Sprint (July 16–17, 2025).

Under cache miss the fallback path performed synchronous disk reads for the public key, causing repeated 3–5ms latency spikes under peak load.Process Flow:1. Parse JWT header and extract kid2. Check in-memory LRU cache (256-entry capacity)3. On cache hit: constant-time lookup to signature verification4. On cache miss: synchronous fs read of public key file, then signature verificationFlame graph analysis shows the disk I/O call consuming 40% of execution time in miss scenarios, confirmed by New Relic traces.Slide 3: Extended Performance AnalysisParagraph: Microbenchmark and production metrics over high-load tests (10k RPS) validate stability and regression boundaries.Table: Performance Metrics Across Environments| Scenario            | P50 Latency | P95 Latency | P99 Latency | Avg Latency | Std Dev ||---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|| Warm Cache (Test)   | 0.9ms       | 1.4ms       | 2.1ms       | 1.2ms       | 0.15ms  || Cold Cache (Test)   | 3.8ms       | 4.7ms       | 5.6ms       | 4.5ms       | 0.7ms   || Warm Cache (Prod)   | 1.1ms       | 1.6ms       | 2.4ms       | 1.3ms       | 0.2ms   || Cold Cache (Prod)   | 4.0ms       | 5.0ms       | 6.0ms       | 4.7ms       | 0.8ms   |Observations: Production results are within 10% of test harness metrics and show no regressions post-deployment.Slide 4: Roadmap and Action ItemsParagraph: To ensure resilience and adaptability, the following roadmap outlines targeted deliverables and deadlines.Action Items:- AI-007: Integrate end-to-end load tests for key rotation scenarios (Owner: porshab, Due: 2025-07-31)- AI-008: Implement dynamic cache resizing triggers based on miss-rate and CPU thresholds (Owner: bevmcg, Due: 2025-08-02)- AI-009: Enhance telemetry with cache hit/miss time-series panels in Grafana (Owner: wilfordt, Due: 2025-07-30)- AI-010: Update incident runbook with dynamic resize and cooldown verification commands (Owner: bevmcg, Due: 2025-07-29)Slide 5: Risk Assessment and Mitigation StrategiesParagraph: Potential risks of dynamic resizing include oscillation and performance regressions. Mitigation includes enforced cooldown periods, parameterized thresholds, and rollback via blue-green deployment and smoke tests.Detailed mitigation table and configuration references are documented in auth_service/config/cache_settings.yaml and the incident runbook (DOC-1123).","TimeStamp":"2025-07-26T14:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-23T18:30:00Z","FileId":"ab60f11f-2780-4358-9938-30ae82df6a35","FileLocation":"files\\DevSecOps_Policy_Threshold_Adjustments.docx","FileName":"DevSecOps_Policy_Threshold_Adjustments.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-23T18:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_markitas","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_kerenguisbert","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_ashleyengel","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/Planning","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Document detailing updated policy thresholds for critical (1), high (0), medium (3) severities; conformance to Confluence schema contract; version control tagging guidelines; process for quarterly reviews; CI pipeline governance definitions.

In this paper, we evaluate the performance characteristics of the OTLP gRPC exporter versus a traditional Kafka-based exporter under microservices workloads. We measure latency, throughput, CPU and memory usage, and reliability across multiple scenarios. Our findings reveal that the OTLP gRPC exporter offers lower latency by up to 15% at the cost of a 10% increase in CPU utilization compared to Kafka. We discuss implications for designing observability pipelines and propose best practices for deployment [1] [2].1. IntroductionObservability in distributed systems relies on ingesting telemetry data with minimal overhead. While OTLP provides a vendor-neutral protocol, many organizations continue to use Kafka as a scalable transport layer [3]. This study addresses the lack of empirical benchmarks comparing these exporters in real-world settings.2. Background and Related WorkPrior research has explored gRPC performance in RPC frameworks [4], and Kafka’s role in telemetry architectures [5]. However, there is limited work directly comparing these approaches for metrics and trace export in high-throughput environments.3. MethodologyWe instrumented a sample microservice application generating 10,000 metrics per second. Two exporters were configured: OTLP gRPC direct to Collector, and Kafka appender with a dedicated cluster. Tests were conducted on m5.large EC2 instances over a network latency emulation of 10-50 ms. We collected end-to-end latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99), CPU, memory, and error rates over 1-hour runs.4. ResultsOTLP gRPC average P95 latency was 120 ms, compared to 140 ms for Kafka. At high load, P99 latencies diverged: 200 ms for gRPC, 250 ms for Kafka. CPU utilization averaged 65% for gRPC, 55% for Kafka, while memory usage remained within 10% difference. Both exporters achieved >99.9% delivery success rate.5. DiscussionThe lower latency of gRPC makes it suitable for low-latency observability requirements. However, Kafka’s burst buffering can absorb spikes, providing smoother throughput. We recommend hybrid architectures that leverage OTLP for real-time telemetry and Kafka for batch processing.6. ConclusionThis study provides actionable insights for observability pipeline design. Future work includes evaluating security and multi-tenant implications of OTLP and Kafka integrations.References[1] John Smith et al., OpenTelemetry Best Practices, International Conference on Cloud Observability, 2023.[2] Maria Lopez, Comparative Analysis of Telemetry Exporters, Journal of Microservices Engineering, 2024.[3] A.

As our platform responds to varying load conditions, it is critical to ensure that capacity adjustments do not introduce instability. Thrash prevention is achieved by enforcing a configurable cooldown period between resize operations and by monitoring resize events to warn when thresholds are exceeded.In a dynamic resizing model, the cache adapts its capacity in response to miss-rate and CPU utilization metrics. When the miss-rate exceeds the defined threshold over the evaluation window, the cache increases its size by the up_size parameter. Similarly, when CPU usage climbs above its threshold and the hit-rate remains high, the cache decreases in size. Without proper controls, these adjustments can oscillate rapidly, leading to cache thrashing and unpredictable performance.To mitigate this risk, the cache_settings.yaml schema includes a cooldown_period property that defines the minimum interval between successive resize actions. This period is measured from the timestamp of the last applied resize event. During this interval, further resize triggers are ignored, and any attempts to adjust the cache size increment a thrash warning counter. By capturing these events in jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, we gain visibility into how often resize requests are suppressed.The CacheResizerService in the authentication microservice implements this logic. After fetching metrics from Prometheus via the metrics client, it evaluates conditions such as:    long elapsed = now - lastResizeTime;    if (missRate > config.getMissThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize + config.getUpSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else if (cpuUtil > config.getCpuThreshold() && hitRate > config.getHitThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize - config.getDownSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else {        thrashWarningsCounter.increment();    }This approach ensures that cache size adjustments occur no more frequently than configured, and that any suppressed triggers are accounted for. The updateCapacity method performs boundary checks against minCapacity and maxCapacity before applying changes.On the monitoring side, we introduce a Prometheus recording rule that accumulates jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, and a Grafana panel that overlays the warning counter with jwt_cache_current_size. This correlation allows engineers to quickly identify periods where the cache reached its cooldown limit. An alert can be configured to fire when thrash warnings increment multiple times within a short timeframe, indicating that operational thresholds may need tuning.Finally, we integrate thrash regression tests into our CI pipeline. The test suite simulates continuous miss-rate spikes and verifies that no more than one resize event occurs per cooldown period. This is achieved by injecting mock metrics and advancing the internal clock within the CacheResizerService. Any deviation from expected behavior fails the build, providing immediate feedback.In production, runbook procedures include instructions to inspect the thrash warning metrics and to adjust cooldown settings if necessary. By combining configuration controls, robust implementation, and comprehensive monitoring, we ensure that dynamic resizing enhances cache efficiency without sacrificing system stability.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-29T08:30:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"4c2f25bd-b434-474b-b25d-ffcb04d54bd9","ChatType":"Meeting","EventId":"0f1e1ece-ca4a-4371-bf61-fe216cce633a","Members":["lod_shakiag","lod_wilfordt","lod_bevmcg","lod_porshab","lod_kerenguisbert","lod_tonycool","lod_luger"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"4f70badd-b215-4541-8ff7-bee2da201c0c","From":"lod_bevmcg","ContentType":"text","Content":"Thanks everyone for the session.

Executive SummaryThis document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance our SDK Delivery Pipeline by integrating dynamic vulnerability thresholding based on CVSS v3.1 scores. Building on the recent SDK Delivery Pipeline Deep Dive held on July 24, 2025, we propose to evolve the existing medium-severity gate to support service-specific policies and manual override flags. The plan details new components, integration points with NVD, updates to Jenkins shared libraries, and modifications to Helm chart values. Our goal is to reduce false positives, accelerate promotions, and maintain alignment with LiveOak Digital security standards.2. Background and ContextDuring the July 23 maintenance session, we introduced a fixed MEDIUM severity threshold in the Trivy scan stage. On July 24, the deep dive workshop surfaced requirements for a more granular policy that maps each CVE to its CVSS base score and allows dynamic thresholds per service component. Current limitations include sequential NVD lookups without caching, lack of threshold overrides, and Helm chart values hardcoded to a single image tag. This plan addresses these gaps and provides a roadmap for incremental delivery.[Page 2 of 4]3. Objectives and ScopeThe primary objectives are:- Develop a CVSS v3.1 Mapping Module in the Jenkins pipeline shared library.- Integrate an NVD API client with retry, caching, and parallel lookup support.- Extend the pipeline DSL to read threshold configurations from charts/sdk-java/values.yaml.- Implement manual override flags for non-critical CVEs (CVSS <5.0).- Update Helm chart templates to consume dynamic threshold values and image tags.Out of scope:- Upstream changes to third-party libraries beyond the CI pipeline.- Non-Java SDK projects (to be addressed in subsequent phases).4. Proposed Architecture and Design4.1 CVSS v3.1 Mapping ModuleWe will introduce a new Groovy class `CvssMapper` in `pipeline-shared@1.3.0` that accepts a list of CVE identifiers and returns a map of CVE to base score. The module will leverage thread pools for parallel HTTP GET requests to the NVD restful endpoint and maintain an in-memory synchronized cache for session-level deduplication.4.2 NVD API Integration LayerThe `NvdClient` component encapsulates token-based authentication, exponential backoff on HTTP 429, and JSON parsing. It will expose methods:```groovyMap<String,Float> lookupBatch(List<String> cves)```which returns CVSS base scores. We will test this client with unit tests in `pipeline-shared/src/test/groovy/CvssMapperSpec.groovy` using mocked HTTP responses.4.3 Dynamic Threshold ConfigurationChart values in `charts/sdk-java/values.yaml` will gain a new section:```yamltrivyThresholds:  defaultMaxScore: 5.0  overrides:    inventory-service: 4.5    orders-service: 5.5```The pipeline will read these values at runtime via `withCredentials` and `readYaml` steps. Images tagged `liveoak/sdk-java:${IMAGE_TAG}` will adopt thresholds based on service context.[Page 3 of 4]5.

As our platform responds to varying load conditions, it is critical to ensure that capacity adjustments do not introduce instability. Thrash prevention is achieved by enforcing a configurable cooldown period between resize operations and by monitoring resize events to warn when thresholds are exceeded.In a dynamic resizing model, the cache adapts its capacity in response to miss-rate and CPU utilization metrics. When the miss-rate exceeds the defined threshold over the evaluation window, the cache increases its size by the up_size parameter. Similarly, when CPU usage climbs above its threshold and the hit-rate remains high, the cache decreases in size. Without proper controls, these adjustments can oscillate rapidly, leading to cache thrashing and unpredictable performance.To mitigate this risk, the cache_settings.yaml schema includes a cooldown_period property that defines the minimum interval between successive resize actions. This period is measured from the timestamp of the last applied resize event. During this interval, further resize triggers are ignored, and any attempts to adjust the cache size increment a thrash warning counter. By capturing these events in jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, we gain visibility into how often resize requests are suppressed.The CacheResizerService in the authentication microservice implements this logic. After fetching metrics from Prometheus via the metrics client, it evaluates conditions such as:    long elapsed = now - lastResizeTime;    if (missRate > config.getMissThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize + config.getUpSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else if (cpuUtil > config.getCpuThreshold() && hitRate > config.getHitThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize - config.getDownSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else {        thrashWarningsCounter.increment();    }This approach ensures that cache size adjustments occur no more frequently than configured, and that any suppressed triggers are accounted for. The updateCapacity method performs boundary checks against minCapacity and maxCapacity before applying changes.On the monitoring side, we introduce a Prometheus recording rule that accumulates jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, and a Grafana panel that overlays the warning counter with jwt_cache_current_size. This correlation allows engineers to quickly identify periods where the cache reached its cooldown limit. An alert can be configured to fire when thrash warnings increment multiple times within a short timeframe, indicating that operational thresholds may need tuning.Finally, we integrate thrash regression tests into our CI pipeline. The test suite simulates continuous miss-rate spikes and verifies that no more than one resize event occurs per cooldown period. This is achieved by injecting mock metrics and advancing the internal clock within the CacheResizerService. Any deviation from expected behavior fails the build, providing immediate feedback.In production, runbook procedures include instructions to inspect the thrash warning metrics and to adjust cooldown settings if necessary. By combining configuration controls, robust implementation, and comprehensive monitoring, we ensure that dynamic resizing enhances cache efficiency without sacrificing system

By integrating real-time telemetry and a threshold-driven controller, we ensure that cache capacity adapts automatically to workload fluctuations, maintaining sub-3 ms p95 jwt_validation_latency and preventing backpressure in the streaming pipeline.Design and Implementation:At service startup, the LRU cache preloads active public keys, eliminating synchronous disk I/O on misses. The resize controller monitors the miss-rate metric (jwt_cache_miss_rate) over a sliding window (stabilityWindow) and triggers capacity increases of maxGrow entries when the miss rate exceeds missThreshold. Each resize action is subject to a cooldown (cooldownMs) to prevent oscillations. Metrics are emitted via Micrometer and collected by Prometheus, with recording rules tagged by phase (unit-test, smoke-test, canary) and environment (staging).Configuration Parameters:The dynamic_cache_settings.yaml file defines key parameters: maxCap: 512 (upper bound), maxGrow: 75 (entries per resize), stabilityWindow: 3m (miss-rate evaluation window), cooldownMs: 600000 (10-minute interval between resizes), and missThreshold: 0.01 (1% miss rate trigger). These defaults have been validated in staging canary runs at 8k msg/sec, showing two resize events with stable latencies and zero OOM events.Next Steps:We recommend integrating the dynamic resizing health check into the incident runbook and adding a Prometheus alert (CacheResizeMissThresholdBreached) to flag sustained miss-rate breaches. Additionally, updating the CI pipeline templates to parameterize missThreshold values will enable us to test boundary scenarios automatically.

The dynamic “zap_scan_failures_total” ratio is evaluated at runtime, and I set the default gating threshold at 2%. This ensures that intermittent scanning flakiness does not block valid changes while maintaining strict enforcement on high-severity findings.We also integrated HashiCorp Vault approle login for credential management, loading STAGING_URL and JUNIT_REPORT_DIR as secure environment variables. The pipeline uses a two-step vaultToken retrieval with retry logic to handle rate limits. Tokens are then stashed and unstashed across parallel Bandit modules to reduce redundant logins and improve performance.During the hands-on workshop, we demonstrated RS256-only JWT validation in Go within the auth-service client.

It is intended to guide implementation in the checkout-service-deployment job and ensure consistent reproduction across teams.The Compliance Enforcement stage is positioned in the Post-Test-Gates sequence and executes only after unit tests and integration tests have passed. It begins by assigning roles via the Role-based Authorization Strategy plugin to enforce least privilege deployment and remote access controls.Role definitions for least_privilege_deployer and remote_access_operator are declared in the Jenkinsfile using the plugin’s DSL. Permissions are bound to the checkout-service-deployment job folder so that only designated principals can invoke sensitive operations.The stage invokes the OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin against the liveoak/checkout-service:${params.VERSION}-canary container image with the FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02 profile. Upon completion, HTML and CSV reports are archived as build artifacts to provide detailed control-by-control results.Once the scan completes and artifacts are archived, a manual input gate is presented for the engineering-secpkg group to approve the findings. This gate enforces AC-17 policy sign-off and serves as a human checkpoint before production rollout.In the event of scan failures or high-severity findings, the stage triggers the feature-flag rollback logic automatically and sends a templated Slack alert to the #platform-planning channel with the summary of the failure and rollback initiation metric.This stage integrates with our LaunchDarkly feature flag framework by leveraging the retroactiveScan flag, ensuring that any deviation from compliance thresholds can be remediated through automatic rollbacks without requiring additional scripting.By standardizing the Compliance Enforcement stage in a dedicated Jenkins pipeline snippet, we reduce drift between teams and maintain alignment with regulatory requirements while preserving our continuous delivery velocity.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-20T14:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-26T14:00:00Z","FileId":"66d3c93f-87ca-470a-934d-292fde4e154d","FileLocation":"files\\Security_Automation_Pipeline_Gating_Framework_Study_v1.0.pdf","FileName":"Security_Automation_Pipeline_Gating_Framework_Study_v1.0.pdf","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-26T14:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_danillec","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_cortezdehn","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saturninasoyke","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_shawnnas","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Title: Formalizing Security Automation Pipeline Gating Mechanisms: A Comprehensive StudyAbstractThis paper presents a formal analysis and evaluation of security automation pipeline gating mechanisms within enterprise CI/CD environments. We introduce a modular framework that integrates static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and secure credential management. Empirical metrics collected from LiveOak Digital's auth-service pipeline demonstrate improvements in enforcement fidelity and execution performance.1. IntroductionContinuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines have become critical enablers of modern software delivery. As security scanning tools such as Bandit and OWASP ZAP are integrated, the need for a formal gating framework arises to avoid ad hoc implementations and ensure reliable enforcement of vulnerability policies [1].2. Related WorkSmith and Lee [1] propose a taxonomy of security scan integrations and discuss modular stage orchestration. Doe et al. [2] evaluate container caching strategies to reduce pipeline execution time. However, these studies do not address formal threshold modeling or credential management semantics required in enterprise environments.3. Gating Framework Architecture3.1 Stage OrchestrationWe model scan stages as nodes in a directed acyclic graph and define guard predicates g_sast and g_dast based on severity metrics S and D. A pipeline state transitions only if g_sast(S) && g_dast(D) evaluate to true.3.2 Credential ManagementWe adopt the HashiCorp Vault approle authentication pattern with a two-step token retrieval process and retry logic to handle rate limits. This design is informed by observations from Security_Automation_Pipeline_Detailed_Analysis.xlsx [3].4. Implementation in Jenkins Shared LibraryWe extend pipeline-shared@v1.2.0 with a dedicated securityGate stage that wraps both Bandit and ZAP scans under timeout and credential binding. Code excerpt:pipeline {  stages {    stage('securityGate') {      steps {        timeout(time:30, unit:'MINUTES') {          withCredentials([string(credentialsId:'vault_secret', variable:'VAULT_TOKEN')]) {            sh 'bandit -r . --json-report bandit.json'            sh 'zap-full-scan.py -t http://staging.example.com --jsonReport zap.json'          }        }      }      post {        failure {          archiveArtifacts artifacts:'**/*.json'          error 'High-severity findings detected'        }      }    }  }}5. Evaluation5.1 Performance MetricsUsing data from Security_Automation_Pipeline_Detailed_Analysis.xlsx [3], we measured a parallelized average scan duration of 18 minutes, a 66.7% reduction from the serial baseline of 54 minutes reported in [2].5.2 Enforcement ReliabilityOver 10,000 pipeline runs, we recorded zero false negatives for high-severity flags and consistent failure responses when thresholds were exceeded, validating our formal guard design.6. DiscussionOur framework permits provable enforcement properties and can be extended to additional security tools. Future work includes probabilistic modeling of scan flakiness and formal verification of pipeline transitions.7.

It expands on the two feature flags ‘‘checkout_sql_batch_enabled’’ and ‘‘hibernate_query_cache_enabled’’ defined in our LaunchDarkly workspace, elaborating on how these flags were integrated into our continuous delivery pipeline via Helm and environment-variable wrappers. By outlining the precise mechanics of flag injection and the Helm-values configuration in vars/featureFlags.groovy, we intend to share the technical patterns that enabled a seamless switch between the legacy and optimized code paths without full redeploys, preserving service stability under peak load.The integration of these flags into our Kubernetes deployments leverages our shared Jenkins library, which was updated to accept flag values at build time. The pipeline now passes ‘‘checkout_sql_batch_enabled’’ and ‘‘hibernate_query_cache_enabled’’ as environment variables in the container spec, using --set override flags in the Helm release command. This design allows us to perform a canary deployment by toggling flag values against a specific canary instance of checkout-service:v1.2.3-canary. We maintain consistent naming conventions for the flags and reference them in the deployment chart’s values.yaml to avoid drift between staging and production environments.Our A/B testing methodology executes in two phases. The first phase directs 5 percent of incoming traffic to the canary instance for three hours, during which we collect P95 latency, error-rate, and deadlock counts via Prometheus histograms and custom JProfiler metrics published through Micrometer. We established performance thresholds of P95 latency below 200 milliseconds and maximum CPU utilization under 70 percent. Grafana dashboards were configured to automatically refresh every 30 seconds, providing near‐real-time visibility into histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{flag=~\"batchEnabled|cacheEnabled\"}[1m])) by (le)). Following successful validation at 5 percent, we amplify the canary slice to 50 percent traffic and re‐evaluate for another three-hour window.To mitigate risk, we defined precise progression criteria and rollback contingencies. Should P95 latency exceed our SLA or if any SQLExceptions indicating new deadlocks appear in the application logs, the Jenkins pipeline invokes a built-in rollback stage that flips the flags back to ‘‘false’’ and automatically triggers helm rollback for the canary release. We also added a manual approval gate prior to the 100 percent enablement step, ensuring sign-off from Security, QA, and Product stakeholders via an input step that references the OpenSCAP scan report archived as build artifacts.Next steps include finalizing the Confluence page in EngineeringDocuments space with code snippets, pipeline screenshots, and a link to this detailed strategy doc. We will convene a cross-functional review on July 22 to confirm the rollout timeline and to synchronize on the production canary launch. All artifacts, including the updated Jenkinsfile, Helm chart overrides, and Grafana dashboard JSON, are attached as linked files in our shared repository for traceability and audit compliance.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-20T13:15:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-21T11:30:00Z","FileId":"20f869f9-cb03-45f3-8740-3728d5dad6d2","FileLocation":"files\\Compliance_Enforcement_DeepDive.pptx","FileName":"Compliance_Enforcement_DeepDive.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-21T11:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_saturninasoyke","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title SlideTitle: Compliance Enforcement Deep DiveSubtitle: Integrating FedRAMP Controls into CI/CD PipelinePresenter: Saturnina Soyke, Director of Platform EngineeringDate: July 21, 2025Slide 2: Agenda- Introduction & Objectives- CI/CD Pipeline Overview- Role-Based Authorization Integration- OpenSCAP Compliance Stage- Metrics & Monitoring Dashboards- Automated Rollback Logic- Live Demonstration- Next Steps & Timeline- Q&ASlide 3: CI/CD Pipeline OverviewDescription: High-level flow from code commit to production rollout, illustrating build, test, canary, compliance, audit, and sign-off stages.Image: pipeline_architecture_diagram.png (alt text: Diagram showing Jenkins pipeline stages with labeled compliance gate between A/B tests and final promotion)Slide 4: Role-Based Authorization (RBA)Details:• Enforce least-privilege for deployment• Define roles: least_privilege_deployer, remote_access_operator• Bind permissions using Role-based Authorization Strategy pluginCode Snippet Preview:```roles {  least_privilege_deployer {    permissions: [JOB_READ, JOB_BUILD]  }  remote_access_operator {    permissions: [HOST_CONNECT]  }}``` Image: rba_configuration_snippet.png (alt text: Jenkinsfile snippet defining RBA roles)Slide 5: OpenSCAP Compliance StageDescription:• Invokes OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin against canary image• Uses FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02 profile• Archives HTML & CSV reports as build artifactsCode Snippet Preview:```openscap 'FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02'archiveArtifacts 'compliance-report.html','compliance-summary.csv'``` Slide 6: Metrics & MonitoringDescription:• Dashboard tracks compliance pass rates, approval status, P95 latencies• Prometheus & Grafana integrationImage: compliance_metrics_dashboard.png (alt text: Grafana dashboard showing pass rates and P95 latency trends)Slide 7: Automated Rollback LogicDescription:• Feature flag 'retroactiveScan' toggles rollback stage• Triggers rollback on scan failure or high-severity findingsFlow:1.

It outlines architecture diagrams, sequence flows, configuration schemas, and integration points necessary to adopt adaptive cache resizing for production readiness.Section 2: Static Cache Baseline2.1 Overview of Static LRU Cache  - Preloads 256 public keys at service startup to eliminate disk I/O on cache hits.  - Evicts least-recently-used entries when capacity is reached.  - Monitors cache hit/miss metrics via Prometheus.Figure 1: Static Cache Flow Diagram[Image: Cache_Architecture_Diagram illustrating key preload, lookup, and eviction paths]Section 3: Dynamic Resizing Extension3.1 Design Goals  - Automatically adjust cache capacity based on operational metrics.  - Prevent unexpected latency spikes due to forced eviction under load.  - Maintain memory efficiency by shrinking cache during low-load periods.3.2 Metrics and Triggers  - jwt_cache_current_size: Gauge reflecting current cache capacity.  - jwt_cache_hit_total, jwt_cache_miss_total: Counters to compute miss-rate.  - CPU utilization threshold: evaluated via service telemetry.3.3 Resize Rules  - Upsize Condition: miss_rate > 1% sustained over 5 minutes    Action: increase capacity by 50 entries, up to max 512    Cooldown: 10 minutes  - Downsize Condition: CPU > 70% and hit_rate > 99% over 5 minutes    Action: decrease capacity by 25 entries, down to min 128    Cooldown: 10 minutesFigure 2: Dynamic Resizing Sequence Diagram[Image: Sequence_Diagram illustrating metric evaluation, rule engine, and cache adjustment]Section 4: Configuration SchemaThe following YAML schema defines the dynamic resize sections in auth_service/config/cache_settings.yaml:```yamlresize:  miss_threshold: 0.01  cpu_threshold: 0.7  up_size: 50  down_size: 25  min_capacity: 128  max_capacity: 512  evaluation_window: 5m  cooldown_period: 10m```Figure 3: Configuration Screenshot[Image: Screenshot of cache_settings.yaml with highlighted parameters]Section 5: Integration and Visualization5.1 Prometheus Recording Rules  - jwt_cache_resize_events_total: Counter for resize operations  - Alert: More than 3 resize events in 10 minutes triggers a warning5.2 Grafana Panels  - Panel 1: Cache Capacity Over Time  - Panel 2: Miss Rate vs. Capacity  - Panel 3: CPU Utilization and Hit RateFigure 4: Grafana Dashboard Mockup[Image: Mockup image showing panels for capacity, miss rate, CPU, hit rate]Section 6: Sequence of Operations1. Metrics Collector polls Prometheus every 30s2. Rule Engine evaluates conditions based on sliding windows3. If trigger met and cooldown elapsed, Resizer updates capacity4. CacheManager applies new capacity and emits event5. Monitoring and alerting reflect changes in real-timeSection 7: ConclusionDynamic resizing enhances the resilience and performance of our authentication service by adapting cache capacity to traffic patterns. This guide should serve as a reference for implementation, configuration, and operational monitoring to maintain sub-200ms JWT verification latency under varying load conditions.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-26T09:15:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-24T12:15:00Z","FileId":"7214cbee-bfdb-457b-8576-b7ef96d521d4","FileLocation":"files\\JWT_Cache_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","FileName":"JWT_Cache_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-24T12:15:00Z","Owner":"lod_nilatanguma","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_tonycool","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_porshab","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Deep Dive into JWT Cache PerformanceParagraph: This slide summarizes microbenchmark and production metrics for the JWT LRU cache.

Overview2. Goals and Objectives3. Scope and Deliverables4. Timeline and Milestones5. Roles and Responsibilities6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies7. Communication Plan8. Next Steps1. OverviewThis document outlines the detailed plan for finalizing and merging the feature/vault-integration branch into the main code line, scheduling production validation, and coordinating cross-team communication. It is intended for stakeholders in the Security, Platform, and Engineering teams to provide transparency on deliverables, dependencies, and timelines.2. Goals and ObjectivesThe primary objective is to ensure a seamless rollout of the vault integration enhancements developed over the past week. Key deliverables include the implementation of exponential backoff with jitter, a thread-safe LRU cache for AppRole tokens, and robust revocation logic to satisfy FISMA SI-10 controls. Secondary objectives are to update monitoring dashboards, verify Prometheus counters, and embed compliance references in Confluence and the runbook.3. Scope and DeliverablesDeliverables:- Pull request merge for parameterized securityGate.groovy and HVAC retry decorators- Execution of the staging smoke test matrix (vault_smoke_metrics.csv) with zero login failures- Wiki updates under “Security Library” featuring code samples for lock, stash, and revokeVaultToken- Confluence compliance mapping document linking every code change to the FISMA SI-10 checklist and SonarQube quality gates- Post-merge rollback procedures in the CI fragments runbook to disable vault stages if necessary4.

Roles and ResponsibilitiesJason Adon (Solutions Architect): Lead merge approval, schedule and host the July 24 sync meeting, update the runbook and compliance links.Shakia Gencarelli (Senior Software Engineer): Finalize the securityGate.groovy PR, execute TTL and guard-check tests, and update Jenkins shared library fragment.Sau Alquesta (Platform Technical Lead): Validate Grafana dashboard provisioning, coordinate DAST/SAST threshold parameterization, and confirm alert cooldown settings.Nila Tanguma (Engineering Manager): Oversee the overall risk assessment, sign off on compliance mapping, and ensure cross-team alignment.6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation StrategiesRisk: Vault token expiration during long-running jobs leading to stash/unstash failures. Mitigation: Increase default TTL to 3600 seconds, implement guard checks in the retry decorator, and document fallback procedures.Risk: Alert flapping on transient HTTP errors from Vault. Mitigation: Introduce jitter in the retry logic, update Grafana alerts with a 5-minute cooldown, and monitor vault_approle_login_failures_total for anomalies.Risk: Rollback plan not validated before merge. Mitigation: Conduct dry-run of disabling vault stages in a staging fragment, document steps in the runbook, and assign a rollback owner for on-call coverage.7. Communication PlanA 30-minute sync meeting (EventId: 239571e1-6fe5-4283-8957-2467e9bf28ce) is scheduled on July 24 at 3:00 PM PST to review final test results, address blocking issues, and confirm merge readiness. Post-merge status updates will be sent via email to the Security Pipeline distribution list, with the vault_smoke_metrics.csv report attached for visibility.8. Next Steps- Complete merge pull request and secure two independent code reviews by July 26 EOD.- Execute production smoke tests immediately after merge and distribute findings by July 27 EOD.- Update Confluence pages with final architecture diagrams and direct links to compliance artifacts.- Monitor vault operations in production for 48 hours and report any anomalies to the Platform on-call rotation.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-24T22:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-25T16:00:00Z","FileId":"c8bbeec2-5480-4c24-8cb0-ba676c6db60b","FileLocation":"files\\Vault_Integration_Outcomes_and_Infographic.pptx","FileName":"Vault_Integration_Outcomes_and_Infographic.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-25T16:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_jasonadon","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_loriaf","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_shawnnas","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"SecurityPipeline/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title & Overview- Title: Vault Integration Outcomes & Infographic Review- Presenter: Jason Adon- Date: 2025-07-25- Objective: Summarize vault integration enhancements, performance gains, compliance statusSlide 2: Agenda1.

Our goal is to ensure that users receive consistent and informative error responses while maintaining full traceability of failures for compliance and diagnostic purposes. The patterns described in this guide build on the work conducted during the recent Onboarding Unit Tests Deep Dive Session and incorporate boundary case considerations for timestamp parsing and null payload scenarios.The first section reviews the default behavior of Spring’s @ExceptionHandler annotation and the importance of centralizing exception mapping logic. We demonstrate how to extend the existing handler in UserProfileControllerAdvice to catch both IllegalArgumentException and DateTimeParseException. By consolidating these exceptions into a unified bad request response, we reduce code duplication across controllers and improve the user experience for clients consuming our REST API. The guide provides code snippets showing the updated handler signature and explains the rationale for including multiple exception types within a single annotation array.Next, we address the critical boundary scenarios that emerged from the onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml file. The missingTimestamp case highlights the need to detect null or empty timestamp strings early in the request processing pipeline and to return a clear ‘MISSING_TIMESTAMP’ error code. For the timestampLeapSecond scenario, we walk through parsing logic that leverages Java’s DateTimeFormatter with ResolverStyle.STRICT to correctly validate leap second inputs, accompanied by a fallback mapping to an ‘INVALID_TIMESTAMP’ error response. These examples illustrate how to integrate custom validation into the controller advice and ensure consistency with our JUnit parameterized tests.Finally, the guide outlines best practices for enriching error responses with traceability metadata. We recommend including a unique correlation ID and the original exception message in the ErrorResponse payload, as well as logging the full stack trace and request context at the INFO level. By configuring our Jenkins pipeline to aggregate test results and coverage metrics under the UnitTests stage, we can automatically verify that all exception scenarios are covered by our TransactionServiceTest and UserProfileControllerTest suites. This end-to-end approach ensures that any future modifications to exception handling logic are captured by automated tests and gating policies before merging into staging.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-24T10:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-23T13:00:00Z","FileId":"9af8f1e3-978c-4ebe-8ade-83e78481ba54","FileLocation":"files\\Onboarding_Test_Naming_and_Scenario_Guide.docx","FileName":"Onboarding_Test_Naming_and_Scenario_Guide.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-23T13:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_sharij","SharedWith":null,"FileDestination":"Onboarding/Docs","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Onboarding Test Naming and Scenario GuidelinesConsistency in naming conventions across unit tests and scenario definitions is essential to ensure clarity, maintainability, and seamless integration within our CI/CD pipeline. This document presents a concise set of guidelines for structuring JUnit test classes and organizing scenario definitions in the onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml file, aligned with the standards established during the Onboarding Microservice Unit Tests Deep Dive Session.All test class names should adhere to the <ComponentUnderTest>Test pattern, for example, TransactionServiceTest and UserProfileControllerTest. This convention provides immediate recognition of the functionality under test and aligns with our shared test fixtures. Within each class, individual test methods must follow the givenWhenThen naming convention, without underscores, to describe the preconditions, action, and expected outcome. A method name such as givenNullPayloadWhenValidateTransactionThenBadRequest offers a human-readable narrative and supports clear reporting in test execution logs.The onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml file drives our parameterized tests via @MethodSource. Each scenario key must use snake_case for readability and must be enclosed in single quotes. For instance, the keys invalid_user_id, missing_timestamp, timestamp_leap_second, and missing_payload each map directly to MethodSource entries in the corresponding test class. The input and expectedError values within each scenario should also appear as strings in single quotes to ensure proper parsing in test fixtures and YAML processing.When authoring new scenarios, place the definitions under test-resources/onboarding in the shared onboarding-mocks.jar, versioned according to our semantic versioning policy. Ensure that any additions are registered in the Jenkins matrix include block, where COVERAGE_THRESHOLD overrides are configured per module directory. The matrix entries must tag the new scenarios and include failFast: false to prevent early exit on boundary-case errors.Finally, always update our TestStandards.md documentation in the Shared Documents folder to reflect any changes to naming patterns or scenario file structures. By following these guidelines, we maintain a coherent and traceable test suite that integrates reliably with our Jenkins pipeline, empowers clear CI diagnostics, and upholds our compliance requirements under the RSD

Architectural Considerations and Best Practices for OTLP gRPC Exporter in High-Throughput Telemetry PipelinesAuthors: Shakia Gencarelli, Danille Ciardullo, Emory ScherpingAffiliation: LiveOak Digital EngineeringDate: July 31, 2025AbstractThis paper explores the architecture and design tradeoffs involved in integrating the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) gRPC exporter into high-throughput cloud-native telemetry pipelines. Extending the preliminary performance data from Gencarelli et al. [1], we provide additional benchmarks under varying network jitter, compression settings, and batch sizes. We also propose a reference implementation addressing backpressure, retry policies, and fail-fast semantics suitable for enterprise deployments.1. IntroductionTelemetry is a critical component for observability in distributed microservice architectures. The OTLP gRPC exporter offers vendor-neutral transport with lower latency compared to traditional message brokers like Kafka [2]. During the OTLP Exporter Q&A Roundtable on July 29, 2025 [3], our team discussed batch sizes of 512 and 1024 spans, gzip compression impact, network jitter up to 100 ms, and P95/P99 latency under sustained 10 k metrics/s loads. Building on those findings, this paper examines end-to-end performance, resource utilization, and resiliency under real-world conditions.2. Background and Related WorkPrevious work on gRPC performance in telemetry contexts highlights sub-millisecond RPC overhead [4]. Brown and Davis demonstrated gRPC latency advantages over HTTP/1.1 in RPC frameworks [5]. However, most studies focus on RPC workloads, not high-volume telemetry streams. Gencarelli’s initial study compared OTLP gRPC to Kafka-based export patterns, showing 15% latency reduction and 10% CPU overhead increase [1]. This paper fills the gap by evaluating jitter robustness, backpressure behavior, and retry policy efficacy in production-like scenarios.3. Design Considerations3.1 Batch SizingBatch size directly influences latency and CPU usage. Our extended tests use 512, 1024, and 2048 spans per batch under 10 k–50 k metrics/s loads. We observe diminishing returns beyond 1024 spans, consistent with sustainedLoad_10000mps_NoJitter_1024 benchmarks [6]. We recommend 1024 as a default, with 2048 for bursty workloads.3.2 Compression TradeoffsGzip compression reduces network payload by 60% but increases CPU utilization by 3–8% and memory overhead by ~8 MB per endpoint [3]. Our memory profiles under 10 k metrics/s loads confirm stable utilization with gzip, but CPU peaks approach 68% on m5.large instances. We propose an opt-in compression flag and runtime toggle for dynamic enabling based on CPU headroom.3.3 Backpressure and RetryIn collector queue-full scenarios, the OTLP exporter blocks gRPC threads, risking throughput collapse [3]. We implement an asynchronous buffer with configurable size and drop-oldest policy to decouple exporter threads. Retry policies use exponential backoff with jitter, configurable in service.yaml under protocol.grpc.retry_policy. Our tests show 99.95% success rates under 50–100 ms jitter with retry enabled.4. Performance Evaluation4.1 Test SetupWe instrumented a microservice generating 20 k metrics/s per instance on Kubernetes. Network latency emulation ranged 0–200 ms jitter. Metrics were collected via HashiCorp’s network emulation for consistency.4.2 ResultsTable 1 summarizes latency and resource usage across scenarios. Under 50–100 ms jitter, P95 latency stayed under 160 ms with batch size 1024 and gzip off, and under 165 ms with gzip on (memory +8 MB overhead). P99 spikes remained under 300 ms in both cases. CPU peaked at 63% without compression, 68% with.4.3 DiscussionThe results validate that OTLP gRPC exporter meets sub-200 ms P95 latency SLAs even under moderate jitter. Batching and compression settings should be tuned per workload. Asynchronous senders prevent backpressure effects, and configurable retry policies ensure delivery durability.5. Deployment Best Practices• Default exporter type: grpc; fallback to kafka via service loader SPI for hybrid architectures.• Batch size configuration: 1024 spans; override via exporter.batchSize parameter.• Compression: disabled by default; enableGrpcCompression flag to opt in.• Backpressure: configure exporter.asyncBufferSize; drop-oldest policy recommended.• Retry: exponential backoff with configurable initialInterval and maxRetries.• Monitoring: expose otlp_exporter_metrics; track HighJitterP99 and ExporterBackpressureDropped metrics in Prometheus.• Security: mTLS enforced via Vault cert rotation; test rotation under load to ensure session continuity.6. ConclusionIntegrating OTLP gRPC exporter into large-scale telemetry pipelines yields significant latency improvements with manageable resource overhead. The reference design presented here addresses common pain points in backpressure, retry, and resource tuning, enabling robust enterprise observability. Future work includes exploring multiplexed HTTP/2 streams and adaptive batch sizing algorithms.References[1] Shakia Gencarelli, \"Evaluating OTLP gRPC Exporter Performance in Cloud-native Telemetry Pipelines,\" LiveOak Digital Engineering, July 2025.[2] John Smith et al., \"OpenTelemetry Best Practices,\" Int.

It consolidates benchmark data, operational trade-offs, and configuration best practices into concise recommendations for enterprise-grade telemetry pipelines.Backpressure Mitigation and Async BufferingCollector queue saturation under high load can block gRPC exporter threads and degrade end-to-end latency. We introduced an asynchronous in-memory buffer with configurable bufferCapacity and a drop-oldest fallback policy. In stress tests simulating sustained 10 000 metrics/s loads, a bufferCapacity of 1024 spans maintained P95 latencies within 160 ms, compared to 180 ms when unbuffered. This buffering approach decouples exporter throughput from collector queue limits and prevents tail-latency spikes.Batch Sizing and Compression Trade-offsTests with batch sizes of 512, 1024, and 2048 spans demonstrate diminishing latency gains beyond 1024 spans. P95 latencies improved from 140 ms (512) to 120 ms (1024) and to 115 ms (2048), while CPU utilization increased from 60 % to 63 % to 65 % respectively. Enabling gzip compression reduces network payloads by approximately 60 % but introduces a 3–8 % CPU overhead and ~8 MB memory overhead per endpoint.

The purpose of this guide is to translate the metrics captured in the attached Chaos_Resource_Utilization_Details.xlsx into clear recommendations for resource configuration and autoscaling of the Chaos Monkey job. By analyzing pod-level CPU and memory trends, we can ensure that future injections maintain the integrity of the staging cluster while validating system resilience under varied load conditions.During the ten-minute injection window, CPU utilization consistently peaked between 60 and 65 percent on chaos-monkey-job pods when MAX_PARALLEL_CHAOS_PODS was set to four. Memory usage similarly approached the configured limit of 512Mi, with several pods reaching upwards of 498Mi under concurrent termination events. Network I/O spikes were measured at 40 percent above baseline during aggressive fault patterns. These observations confirm that our initial resource requests of 500m CPU and 512Mi memory are at the edge of capacity for sustained chaos injection workloads. Detailed time series graphs and per-pod breakdowns are available in the Excel workbook, and should be referenced prior to any configuration changes.Based on these metrics, I recommend updating chaos-monkey-job.yaml to increase CPU requests to 600m and adjust memory requests to 512Mi for all replicas. Enforcing explicit resource limits of 700m CPU and 600Mi memory will provide headroom for transient spikes and avoid OOM termination of pods during test bursts. In parallel, implementing a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configured to target an average CPU utilization of 50 percent will dynamically scale the chaos-monkey deployment between three and six replicas. This approach balances injection parallelism and cluster stability, ensuring that additional resources are available when high volumes of fault events coincide.To implement autoscaling, the HPA specification should reference the chaos-monkey deployment and set metrics based on the standard CPU utilization metric with a 15-second scrape interval. Minimum replicas can be set to three, with a maximum of six, aligning with the staging cluster’s capacity limits. These values will allow the system to respond gracefully to load fluctuations, maintaining test fidelity without manual intervention. It is also important to coordinate with the pipeline automation team to pass the MAX_PARALLEL_CHAOS_PODS parameter through Jenkinsfile.security.groovy when scaling events occur.Next steps include updating the Jenkins pipeline snippet to incorporate the new resource configuration inputs and HPA controls, revising the QA Playbook section under /docs/security/pipeline-best-practices to capture the autoscaling guidance, and scheduling a validation run to confirm the efficacy of these changes. I will coordinate with Danille to embed the updated chaos-monkey-job.yaml fragment in our Confluence documentation and schedule a follow-up session to review the live metrics under autoscaled injection conditions.Emory Scherping, July 25, 2025","TimeStamp":"2025-07-25T17:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-26T11:15:00Z","FileId":"a47f4666-dfff-478b-804c-a029aff615f0","FileLocation":"files\\Chaos_Pipeline_Integration_Strategy.docx","FileName":"Chaos_Pipeline_Integration_Strategy.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-26T11:15:00Z","Owner":"lod_danillec","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_mylesm","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_loriaf","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/PlatformEngineering/Planning","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Chaos Engineering Pipeline Integration StrategyTable of Contents1.

Appendix........................................................141. IntroductionThe incorporation of chaos engineering practices into our CI/CD security pipeline represents a critical evolution in how LiveOak Digital validates system resilience alongside compliance and functional testing. By embedding controlled fault injection directly into Jenkinsfile.security.groovy and gating on both test duration and coverage thresholds, we ensure that resilience validation occurs at the same level of rigor as static code analysis and vulnerability scanning.This document captures the architectural considerations, detailed parameter definitions, autoscaling configurations, and implementation guidelines required to operationalize chaos testing across staging and production-like environments. Stakeholders, including DevOps engineers, QA leads, and platform architects, will use this guide to plan upcoming sprints and align on deliverables.2. Objectives and ScopeThe primary objective is to standardize chaos engineering workflows as part of the secure pipeline, delivering repeatable fault injection experiments that surface resilience regressions early. Key success criteria include:- Parameterizable controls for injection cadence and parallelism.- Automated resource autoscaling to maintain cluster stability.- Clear code snippets and coverage gate logic for Jenkins pipelines.- Actionable dashboards and alerting policies in Prometheus/Grafana.This document is scoped to the transaction-service cluster in the Elk Grove staging environment but establishes patterns that can be extended to other microservices. It assumes prior completion of the compliance addendum and initial chaos experiment design outlined in the July 23 session.3. Parameterization of Chaos Control Parameters3.1 MAX_PARALLEL_CHAOS_PODSIntroduce a string parameter in Jenkinsfile.security.groovy as follows:parameters {  string(name: 'MAX_PARALLEL_CHAOS_PODS', defaultValue: '4', description: 'Maximum parallel Chaos Monkey pod count')  string(name: 'COVERAGE_THRESHOLD', defaultValue: '85', description: 'Coverage gate % for @Category(\\\"chaos\\\") tests')}In the groovy script, fallback defaults ensure that missing parameters do not halt the pipeline:def parallelPods = params.MAX_PARALLEL_CHAOS_PODS ?: '4'def coverageGate = Integer.parseInt(env.COVERAGE_THRESHOLD ?: '85')This pattern simplifies overrides via CLI or feature branches and promotes consistency across teams.3.2 HPA_CPU_TARGET and HPA_STABILIZATION_WINDOWTo reduce manual tuning for autoscaling, we introduce two additional parameters:parameters {  string(name: 'HPA_CPU_TARGET', defaultValue: '60', description: 'HPA target CPU utilization %')  string(name: 'HPA_STABILIZATION_WINDOW', defaultValue: '120', description: 'HPA stabilization window seconds')}These values feed into the dynamic generation of an HPA spec YAML at runtime, ensuring that chaos-monkey-job replicas scale gracefully under varying load patterns.4. Resource Autoscaling and HPA TuningApplying the metrics gathered from the Chaos Resource Utilization Details (FileId:8869db6a-1b7a-496e-8b0a-343411d1be89), we calibrated the following HPA settings:- minReplicas: 3- maxReplicas: 6- targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: ${params.HPA_CPU_TARGET}- stabilizationWindowSeconds: ${params.HPA_STABILIZATION_WINDOW}By default, setting target CPU to 60% with a 120 second stabilization window significantly reduced flapping during test bursts. A sample HPA spec template is provided in the Appendix. Engineers should validate these values in staging and adjust the min/max boundaries based on cluster capacity.5. Pipeline Integration and Code SnippetsThe chaosInjectChaos and chaosUnitTests stages are defined in parallel under the enable flag:stage('Chaos Experiment') {  when {    expression { return ENABLE_CHAOS.toBoolean() }  }  parallel {    chaosInjectChaos {      kubernetes.deploy(        job: 'chaos-monkey',        replicas: Integer.parseInt(parallelPods),        resources: [cpu: '600m', memory: '512Mi']      )    }    chaosUnitTests {      coverage.groovy.filterByCategory('chaos')      coverage.groovy.setThreshold(coverageGate)    }  }}Detailed pipeline templates and Confluence embed links are maintained under /docs/security/pipeline-best-practices.6. Action Plan and Next Steps- Shakia Gencarelli: Merge the parameterized pipeline fragment into feature/hpa-params (due 2025-07-27).- Emory Scherping: Validate HPA behavior under dual eviction scenarios (due 2025-07-28).- Myles Mckoan: Update Confluence documentation with code snippets and autoscaling guide (due 2025-07-28).- Loria Furlan: Coordinate stakeholder review session and finalize rollout plan (due 2025-07-29).7.

We focus on the updated Go service testing conventions, performance gains from container and module caching strategies, and next steps to standardize these improvements across our microservices portfolio.Go Test Hygiene Refinement: We adopted the testify/mock framework with mockery to generate consistent stubs, incorporated t.Cleanup in our table-driven subtests to reset shared state, and integrated go-junit-report into the Go test stage to produce JUnit XML artifacts for GitLab merge request annotations. Our updated docs/ci/fragments/go-tests.yml now enforces a minimum 85% coverage threshold per package and fails the job upon breaches.Parallel Stage Performance: By switching the schema-validator container to an Alpine multi-stage build, we reduced validation time by approximately 15 seconds per run. Additionally, we introduced a Go module cache layer (`go mod download` in a dedicated Docker layer and persisting $GOCACHE on the Jenkins agent) which yields a 30-second cold start improvement for Go tests. Node stage memory consumption was stabilized with `--max-old-space-size=2048`, and we are tracking optimized runtimes in the CI-CD_Pipeline_Stage_Timings.csv dashboard.Next Steps: We will formalize the module caching snippet in our global pipeline template (ci-retrofit-template.yml), roll out the Alpine schema-validator across all parallel gates, and conduct a team review of HPA memory target adjustments (85%→80%) during our next #ci-cd-sync meeting. Finally, I’ll circulate a link to this one-pager and collect feedback before embedding these changes into our CONTRIBUTING.md and Jenkins shared library.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T16:00:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"95b42fbf-5f02-48c5-8e20-228f8f2e3341","ChatType":"Group","ChatName":"CI-CD-Retrospective","Members":["lod_danillec","lod_missbj","lod_markitas","lod_jasonadon","lod_eramanteca","lod_loriaf"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"18b58d89-5048-4e8e-a45f-f7d36b590b50","From":"lod_danillec","ContentType":"text","Content":"Hey team, wanted to share a few retrospective notes from yesterday’s CI/CD working session.

OverviewThis document outlines the detailed plan for finalizing and merging the feature/vault-integration branch into the main code line, scheduling production validation, and coordinating cross-team communication. It is intended for stakeholders in the Security, Platform, and Engineering teams to provide transparency on deliverables, dependencies, and timelines.2. Goals and ObjectivesThe primary objective is to ensure a seamless rollout of the vault integration enhancements developed over the past week. Key deliverables include the implementation of exponential backoff with jitter, a thread-safe LRU cache for AppRole tokens, and robust revocation logic to satisfy FISMA SI-10 controls. Secondary objectives are to update monitoring dashboards, verify Prometheus counters, and embed compliance references in Confluence and the runbook.3. Scope and DeliverablesDeliverables:- Pull request merge for parameterized securityGate.groovy and HVAC retry decorators- Execution of the staging smoke test matrix (vault_smoke_metrics.csv) with zero login failures- Wiki updates under “Security Library” featuring code samples for lock, stash, and revokeVaultToken- Confluence compliance mapping document linking every code change to the FISMA SI-10 checklist and SonarQube quality gates- Post-merge rollback procedures in the CI fragments runbook to disable vault stages if necessary4.

Roles and ResponsibilitiesJason Adon (Solutions Architect): Lead merge approval, schedule and host the July 24 sync meeting, update the runbook and compliance links.Shakia Gencarelli (Senior Software Engineer): Finalize the securityGate.groovy PR, execute TTL and guard-check tests, and update Jenkins shared library fragment.Sau Alquesta (Platform Technical Lead): Validate Grafana dashboard provisioning, coordinate DAST/SAST threshold parameterization, and confirm alert cooldown settings.Nila Tanguma (Engineering Manager): Oversee the overall risk assessment, sign off on compliance mapping, and ensure cross-team alignment.6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation StrategiesRisk: Vault token expiration during long-running jobs leading to stash/unstash failures. Mitigation: Increase default TTL to 3600 seconds, implement guard checks in the retry decorator, and document fallback procedures.Risk: Alert flapping on transient HTTP errors from Vault. Mitigation: Introduce jitter in the retry logic, update Grafana alerts with a 5-minute cooldown, and monitor vault_approle_login_failures_total for anomalies.Risk: Rollback plan not validated before merge. Mitigation: Conduct dry-run of disabling vault stages in a staging fragment, document steps in the runbook, and assign a rollback owner for on-call coverage.7. Communication PlanA 30-minute sync meeting (EventId: 239571e1-6fe5-4283-8957-2467e9bf28ce) is scheduled on July 24 at 3:00 PM PST to review final test results, address blocking issues, and confirm merge readiness. Post-merge status updates will be sent via email to the Security Pipeline distribution list, with the vault_smoke_metrics.csv report attached for visibility.8. Next Steps- Complete merge pull request and secure two independent code reviews by July 26 EOD.- Execute production smoke tests immediately after merge and distribute findings by July 27 EOD.- Update Confluence pages with final architecture diagrams and direct links to compliance artifacts.- Monitor vault operations in production for 48 hours and report any anomalies to the Platform on-call rotation.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-24T22:00:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"742 Redwood Crossing"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Solutions Architecture","DisplayName":"Jason Adon","FirstName":"Jason","JobTitle":"Solutions Architect","LastName":"Adon","MailNickName":"lod_jasonadon","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3172","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

This one-pager provides a technical breakdown of the scaling adjustments and retry logic enhancements that resolved the incident and the next steps for long-term resilience.HPA Configuration Tuning: We increased the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler CPU request from 100m to 200m and lowered the target utilization threshold from 70 percent to 55 percent. A 180 second downscale stabilization window was added to prevent thrashing during transient load dips. In our HPA and Backoff Test Results for iteration seven, these changes reduced scale up time to 40 seconds at 300 QPS and scale down time to 150 seconds, with p95 latency under 120 milliseconds and error rate below 0.5 percent.Retry Backoff Improvements: The retry library in libs/transaction/retry.go was refactored to implement a base delay of 50 milliseconds, cap at 150 milliseconds, and uniform jitter up to 100 milliseconds. Table driven unit tests now simulate rapid 429 sequences to validate delay distributions. Early sandbox benchmarks show a twenty percent reduction in tail latency and elimination of connection pool exhaustion errors in Envoy sidecars.Next Steps: Complete merge of PR number 216 for HPA module tuning and PR number 215 for jitter patch by July 21. Integrate updated histogram buckets and alert thresholds p95 greater than 150 milliseconds and p99 greater than 200 milliseconds into Grafana dashboards. Validate with a canary deployment in staging on July 22.

It outlines the rationale behind each panel’s query expression, describes the presentation options selected to surface the most critical information, and explains how these metrics integrate with our alerting strategy for high reliability.The first section examines the Migration P95 Latency panel, where the expression histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(migration_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, env)) retrieves the 95th percentile of migration durations over a rolling five-minute window. We grouped metrics by the env label to allow side-by-side comparison between staging and production. The threshold line is set at 2 seconds, reflecting our target maximum latency. Color overrides transition from green below 1 second, to yellow between 1 and 2 seconds, and to red above 2 seconds, giving immediate visual feedback on performance trends.Next, the Rollback P95 Latency panel is described. It employs the expression histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(rollback_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, env)) and uses a 2.5-second threshold line to detect regressions in rollback speed. This higher threshold acknowledges that rollback operations may incur additional overhead. Panel configuration leverages unit display in seconds with one decimal precision, and the legend is formatted to show per-environment values in a concise format.The third section details the Rollback Success Rate gauge. Using the expression sum(migration_successful_rollbacks_total) / sum(migration_attempts_total), expressed as a percentage, this panel provides a real-time success metric for rollback operations. We established a static threshold at 98 percent, based on historical run data. The gauge’s background color shifts to red below 95 percent, alerting the team to any systemic issues that may warrant immediate investigation.Finally, the guide addresses panel layout and interaction design choices. We placed these three panels in a dedicated row labeled \"Migration and Rollback Observability,\" ensuring clarity of purpose. We configured hover tooltips to display raw bucket data for deeper analysis and set up drilldown links to our runbook and Prometheus console. These configurations provide on-call engineers quick pathways from high-level alerts to detailed dashboards and documentation.By consolidating these panels into a single, unified dashboard, we aim to reduce time to detection and mean time to resolution for migration-related incidents. This document will be maintained in our EngineeringDocuments repository, and we welcome feedback to refine thresholds and visual settings as our pipeline evolves.","TimeStamp":"2025-06-16T11:15:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"083d8e91-f986-48e4-bac9-88a7f61ccc10","ChatType":"Group","ChatName":"migration-rollback-runbook","Members":["lod_shakiag","lod_eramanteca","lod_nilatanguma","lod_wilfordt","lod_ashleyengel","lod_tisaodon","lod_porshab"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"14d1ca77-b98f-4380-bbde-e2be1aef0a6d","From":"lod_shakiag","ContentType":"text","Content":"I’ve opened the runbook PR in the ops repository: https://github.com/liveoak/ops-repo/pull/234.

The HMAC validation approach is designed to ensure message integrity and protect our Kafka ingestion pipeline from payload tampering. The pseudocode presented highlights the retrieval of the secret key from Vault using the shared library function validateConfigFiles(), the computation of the HmacSHA256 signature, and the constant-time comparison strategy to mitigate timing attack vectors. Detailed code snippets are included to illustrate the integration points within the Java service and the Jenkins hmacValidationTest stage.The secret management strategy leverages Vault’s KV v2 engine with dynamic TTL extension and backoff jitter. The validateConfigFiles() function orchestrates secret retrieval and renewal, anchored by the exponential backoff factor and jitter margin parameters defined in our design document. The document explains the configuration of the Vault-backed OAuth2 service, the 24-hour key rotation schedule, and the integration of the rotation logic into the JwtCacheLRU decorator to enforce eviction of stale credentials before reuse. A section is devoted to the pseudocode for the LRU decorator, showcasing how effectiveTTL is computed and applied within the cache entry refresh cycle.Integration into the CI pipeline is achieved through the Jenkinsfile.security.groovy stage named hmacValidationTest. The document describes how the pipeline fetches the HMAC Vault credentials via Jenkins credentials binding, executes validation tests against representative payload samples, and publishes results to Confluence via REST API. The configuration of JUnit XML reporting and archiving of artifacts is detailed, including the naming conventions and the reports directory structure. Insights into failure thresholds and automated notifications in the #devops-alerts channel are provided to ensure rapid response to test regressions.Performance considerations are addressed with reference to the JMH microbenchmark results captured on June 19. The document presents the P95 and P99 latency measurements under concurrent session loads, illustrating drift percentages under 5% for 3 000 sessions. A comparison of jitter parameters for linux_arm and windows_x64 agents is included, along with recommendations for adjusting default TTL to 4 800 seconds (80 minutes) to accommodate high-QPS login flows. The impact of backoff factor tuning and jitter margin variations on message processing latency is analyzed, supported by charts and metrics drawn from our detailed workbook.Next steps and action items conclude the document. The team is advised to finalize the unit tests for boundary scenarios, validate the constant-time comparison logic with fuzz testing, and parameterize the HMAC key rotation interval in the shared library refactor. A roadmap for the staging rollout is provided, including alignment with the smoke test schedule on June 28 and coordination with QA for end-to-end verification of the HMAC validation layer in the feature/fraud-security-integration branch.","TimeStamp":"2025-06-21T14:45:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-06-19T16:30:00Z","FileId":"b3d7ee88-b857-4eb4-ae82-99ac67370285","FileLocation":"files\\Fraud-Security-Integration_Workshop_Details.xlsx","FileName":"Fraud-Security-Integration_Workshop_Details.xlsx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-06-19T16:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_terinahafen","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_markitas","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_jackschrott","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_kerenguisbert","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Workshops","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Sheet: Threat Modeling Summary:Session,Components,Risks Identified,Mitigations,Owner,StatusDay 1 AM,\"API Gateway→Kafka Ingestion\",\"Token replay;insufficient validation\",\"Vault-backed OAuth2 JWT validation;mTLS\",kerenguisbert,CompletedDay 1 PM,\"Kafka Ingestion→Scoring Engine\",\"Message tampering;eavesdropping\",\"HMAC validation before enqueue;TLS encryption\",ashleyengel,In ProgressSheet: Network Segmentation Rules:PolicyName,Namespace,Purpose,YAMLSnippetNP-Anomaly-Egress,anomaly-scoring-pods,\"Restrict egress to fraud-metrics DB and cache\",\"apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1kind: NetworkPolicymetadata:  name: np-anomaly-egressspec:  podSelector:    matchLabels:      app: anomaly-scoring  egress:    - to:        - podSelector:            matchLabels:              app: fraud-metrics-db      ports:        - protocol: TCP          port: 5432    - to:        - ipBlock:            cidr: 10.1.0.0/16      ports:        - protocol: TCP          port: 6379\",terinahafenSheet: Code Scanning Integration Metrics:Tool,ScanType,Configuration,FailureThreshold,IssuesDetected,ResponsibleBandit,SAST,\"pytest security_tests/sast_bandit.py\",Fail on >0 issues,2 new crypto flags,markitasOWASP ZAP,DAST,\"Full scan stage;2% threshold\",2%,1 timeout,jackschrottSonarQube,SAST,\"Custom OWASP rule profiles;JSON output\",Fail on new crypto issues,3 blockers,bevmcgSheet: Vault Parameterization Details:KVPath,TTL (s),BackoffFactor,Jitter (ms),BlueprintFunction,Responsiblesecret/data/fraud-model,3600→7200,2,250,validateConfigFiles(),octaviajSheet: HMAC Validation Test Cases:Scenario,MessagePayload,ExpectedSignature,Result,CommentsValid message,\"{\\\"user\\\":\\\"abc\\\",\\\"amt\\\":100}\",\"0fa8b1c2\",\"Pass\",\"Signature matches\"Tampered payload,\"{\\\"user\\\":\\\"abc\\\",\\\"amt\\\":1000}\",\"0fa8b1c2\",\"Fail\",\"Payload altered\"Sheet: Microbenchmark Results:TestName,ConcurrentSessions,P99Latency_ms,Drift_pct,NotesJwtCacheLRU_Eviction,3000,4.8,3.2%,Meets <5% drift goalRetryGoBackoff,5000,15.2,2.8%,10% jitter addedSheet: Action Items:Item,Assignee,DueDate,StatusUpdate OpenSCAP profiles,markitas,2025-06-24T17:00:00Z,In ProgressDraft QA edge-case tests,bevmcg,2025-06-25T17:00:00Z,PendingCheck in final design doc,terinahafen,2025-06-20T10:00:00Z,CompletedTrigger staging rollout,jackschrott,2025-06-20T11:00:00Z,Completed","TimeStamp":"2025-06-19T16:30:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"5864bf19-a784-49e3-8783-c5a59922bf85","ChatType":"Group","ChatName":"FraudSecurity-DesignWorkshop","Members":["lod_markitas","lod_octaviaj","lod_bevmcg","lod_kerenguisbert"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"3a430447-a348-458e-bb6d-b857d8f11761","From":"lod_markitas","ContentType":"text","Content":"Hey team, I've updated the Vault KV v2 blueprint in the design doc under 'Secure storage of fraud detection model parameters'.

It builds on the high-level outline distributed in the workshop follow-up note, offering engineers a concrete reference for integrating scanning methods and schema validation into any declarative or scripted Jenkinsfile. The narrative begins by tracing the modular design decisions that led to a maintainable shared library architecture, then drills into the implementation of each core utility method and concludes with integration examples and operational considerations.At the heart of our approach lies a Groovy-based shared library that encapsulates four primary functions: scanWithSnyk, scanWithClair, publishVulnerabilityMetrics, and validatePipelineSchema. The library is organized under src/com/liveoakdevsecops with each method in its own class, accompanied by unit tests in src/test/groovy. We leverage Jenkins classpath isolation and library versioning so that teams can pin to a stable release (e.g., 1.2.0) while updates to the library are published to Artifactory. This separation ensures that incremental enhancements—such as adding new threshold parameters or supporting a secondary scanner—do not disrupt existing pipelines.The scanWithSnyk function is implemented as a thin wrapper around the Snyk CLI, accepting a workspace path and a map of thresholds for project directories. Internally, it constructs a command line string that injects P95 latency and false positive thresholds, then captures SARIF output and archives it to a build artifact folder. The scanWithClair method follows a similar structure but uses Docker to spin up a local Clair service, pipes in the container image reference, and generates JSON results which are then converted to Prometheus counters. The publishVulnerabilityMetrics method collects key metrics—vulnerability_count_by_severity, scan_error_rate, and scan_latency_histogram—from the workspace and pushes them to the Jenkins metrics plugin. The validatePipelineSchema method employs a yaml.safe_load call against our JSON Schema definitions, ensuring that any missing required stages or malformed environment blocks cause a pipeline failure with actionable error messages.To illustrate integration, consider a declarative Jenkinsfile snippet: pipeline { agent any; stages { stage('Validate Config') { steps { sharedLibrary.validatePipelineSchema('schemas/pipeline-schema.json', 'Jenkinsfile') } } stage('Scan') { environment { THRESHOLDS = credentials('scan-thresholds') } steps { sharedLibrary.scanWithSnyk(env.WORKSPACE, THRESHOLDS); sharedLibrary.scanWithClair(env.IMAGE_REF); sharedLibrary.publishVulnerabilityMetrics(env.JOB_NAME) } } } } The shared library automatically loads via the @Library annotation, and the methods handle exit codes and logging according to our team conventions. Engineers are advised to parameterize threshold values via Jenkins credentials or parameterized builds, ensuring repeatable runs across branches and environments. By following this deep dive, teams will be equipped to extend the library for new scanning tools, integrate custom Prometheus recording rules, and maintain consistency in CI/CD vulnerability enforcement across LiveOak Digital’s engineering organization.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-19T09:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-19T11:00:00Z","FileId":"4b98a818-08ce-47b2-9bdd-ff7c35cf050d","FileLocation":"files\\ValidatePipelineSchema_ImplementationGuide.docx","FileName":"ValidatePipelineSchema_ImplementationGuide.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-19T11:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_eramanteca","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_luger","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Scripts","DestinationType":"site","Content":"This implementation guide dives into the validatePipelineSchema function integrated into our Jenkins shared library, providing background on the design rationale, schema management, and usage patterns.All JSON Schema definitions are centrally located within the schemas directory of the shared library repository, versioned alongside the library code to ensure compatibility. The primary schema file, pipeline-schema.json, defines required stages such as agent, stages, and steps, and it enforces naming conventions and environment block structure. Additional subschemas capture common constructs, allowing modular validation across declarative and scripted pipelines.The validatePipelineSchema function is implemented in SchemaValidator.groovy. It leverages a yaml.safe_load call to parse the Jenkinsfile YAML into an object, then applies the JSON Schema using the networknt JSON Schema validator. On failure, the function throws a custom ValidationException that prints a structured report including line number, schema path, and offending value. To maintain developer ergonomics, the error messages include a console table summary and a direct link to documentation in our Confluence page (EngineeringDocuments/Plans/Vulnerability_Scan_Ingestion_Requirements.md#Section7).To invoke the validation stage, pipeline authors simply add a Validate Config stage at the start of their Jenkinsfile, calling sharedLibrary.validatePipelineSchema('schemas/pipeline-schema.json', 'Jenkinsfile'). This design decouples schema enforcement from pipeline definition, allowing teams to pin the shared library to v1.2.0 or higher based on stability requirements. By executing validation early, configuration issues are caught before runtime stages consume invalid input.The corresponding test plan for validatePipelineSchema is captured in PipelineValidation_TestPlan.md. It outlines both positive and negative test scenarios, covering edge cases such as missing required sections, invalid YAML constructs, and unsupported pipeline features. During merge, the integration test suite runs against multiple schema versions (v1, v2), ensuring backward compatibility. Developers should refer to f3c556ab-ad3b-426c-a038-477a1784b781 for test vectors and expected failure messages.By codifying pipeline conventions and enforcing them through automated validation, we reduce configuration drift, accelerate onboarding, and minimize build-time errors. Future enhancements will include schema auto-generation from Jenkins pipeline DSL and improved support for dynamic environment parameters.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-19T11:00:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Pine Creek Lane"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Wilford Taussig","FirstName":"Wilford","JobTitle":"DevOps Engineer","LastName":"Taussig","MailNickName":"lod_wilfordt","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3123","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"123 LiveOak Way"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Shakia Gencarelli","FirstName":"Shakia","JobTitle":"Senior Software Engineer","LastName":"Gencarelli","MailNickName":"lod_shakiag","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2749","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

We detail methodologies for identifying N+1 query defects [1], designing controlled A/B tests for feature-flag rollouts [2], and integrating OpenSCAP-based security scans into a declarative Jenkins pipeline [3]. Our contributions include performance profiling patterns, rollout criteria design, and compliance enforcement blueprints, accompanied by empirical results demonstrating P95 latency improvements from 350 ms to 150 ms and zero SQL deadlocks under high load.1. IntroductionHigh-throughput e-commerce platforms face critical challenges when performance regressions coincide with stringent regulatory controls. In July 2025, the LiveOak Digital platform encountered a 30 percent increase in checkout P95 latency and intermittent SQL deadlocks during peak traffic. As part of the Platform Engineering group, we embarked on a multi-step remediation that combined deep performance analysis with automated compliance validation. This study codifies our approach and lessons learned, contributing to best practices for performance-compliance co-engineering in microservices.2. Performance Profiling MethodologyWe employed dynamic instrumentation via JProfiler and Micrometer histograms [4] to capture full-stack flamegraphs of the payment validation module. Bottleneck analysis identified an N+1 query against the orders table exacerbated by Hibernate cache eviction patterns. We drafted performance test cases with target thresholds (P95 < 200 ms, CPU < 70 percent) and executed A/B comparisons under LaunchDarkly feature flags “checkout_sql_batch_enabled” and “hibernate_query_cache_enabled”. Metrics collection used Prometheus pulls at 30s intervals, aligning with Grafana dashboards for real-time visibility [5].3. Feature Flag Rollout DesignOur rollout strategy defined two phases: a 5 percent traffic slice for 3 hours and a subsequent 50 percent slice pending SLA validation. We automated flag injection via Helm values in the Kubernetes deployment and validated end-to-end latency, error rates, and deadlock counts at each checkpoint. Empirical data showed a P95 drop from 350 ms to 160 ms in the canary slice, enabling safe progression criteria.4. Compliance Enforcement IntegrationTo satisfy FedRAMP Rev 5 controls AC-17 (Remote Access) and SC-02 (Least Privilege), we integrated an OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin stage in the Post-Test-Gates of our pipeline [3]. We defined Role-Based Authorization Strategy roles (least_privilege_deployer, remote_access_operator) to scope permissions, invoked OpenSCAP scans against container images for TLS 1.2+ FIPS-validated cipher suites, and paused for manual security/QE sign-off via an input gate. Fail-fast rollback logic was implemented to trigger feature-flag reversion upon scan failures.5. Results and DiscussionCombined performance tuning and compliance automation yielded P95 latency of 150 ms, CPU max of 60 percent, and zero deadlocks over multi-hour test windows. The integrated pipeline ensured security controls did not impair performance delivery. Key insights include the importance of systematic histograms for real-time decision making [4], and the utility of feature flags as rollback-safe delivery mechanisms [2].6. ConclusionOur case study demonstrates that cohesive engineering processes can reconcile high-performance requirements with stringent compliance mandates. By coupling precise profiling, controlled feature-flag rollouts, and automated security gating, teams can achieve both performance and security objectives without bottlenecking delivery velocity.References[1] A.

It expands on the two feature flags ‘‘checkout_sql_batch_enabled’’ and ‘‘hibernate_query_cache_enabled’’ defined in our LaunchDarkly workspace, elaborating on how these flags were integrated into our continuous delivery pipeline via Helm and environment-variable wrappers. By outlining the precise mechanics of flag injection and the Helm-values configuration in vars/featureFlags.groovy, we intend to share the technical patterns that enabled a seamless switch between the legacy and optimized code paths without full redeploys, preserving service stability under peak load.The integration of these flags into our Kubernetes deployments leverages our shared Jenkins library, which was updated to accept flag values at build time. The pipeline now passes ‘‘checkout_sql_batch_enabled’’ and ‘‘hibernate_query_cache_enabled’’ as environment variables in the container spec, using --set override flags in the Helm release command. This design allows us to perform a canary deployment by toggling flag values against a specific canary instance of checkout-service:v1.2.3-canary. We maintain consistent naming conventions for the flags and reference them in the deployment chart’s values.yaml to avoid drift between staging and production environments.Our A/B testing methodology executes in two phases. The first phase directs 5 percent of incoming traffic to the canary instance for three hours, during which we collect P95 latency, error-rate, and deadlock counts via Prometheus histograms and custom JProfiler metrics published through Micrometer. We established performance thresholds of P95 latency below 200 milliseconds and maximum CPU utilization under 70 percent. Grafana dashboards were configured to automatically refresh every 30 seconds, providing near‐real-time visibility into histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{flag=~\"batchEnabled|cacheEnabled\"}[1m])) by (le)). Following successful validation at 5 percent, we amplify the canary slice to 50 percent traffic and re‐evaluate for another three-hour window.To mitigate risk, we defined precise progression criteria and rollback contingencies. Should P95 latency exceed our SLA or if any SQLExceptions indicating new deadlocks appear in the application logs, the Jenkins pipeline invokes a built-in rollback stage that flips the flags back to ‘‘false’’ and automatically triggers helm rollback for the canary release. We also added a manual approval gate prior to the 100 percent enablement step, ensuring sign-off from Security, QA, and Product stakeholders via an input step that references the OpenSCAP scan report archived as build artifacts.Next steps include finalizing the Confluence page in EngineeringDocuments space with code snippets, pipeline screenshots, and a link to this detailed strategy doc. We will convene a cross-functional review on July 22 to confirm the rollout timeline and to synchronize on the production canary launch. All artifacts, including the updated Jenkinsfile, Helm chart overrides, and Grafana dashboard JSON, are attached as linked files in our shared repository for traceability and audit compliance.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-20T13:15:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"a64ce061-04fa-421e-b562-b9c5679f089b","ChatType":"Meeting","EventId":"62fa5bc5-684d-41b4-936d-6e76aa9a5cef","Members":["lod_kerenguisbert","lod_shakiag","lod_danillec","lod_octaviaj","lod_jackschrott"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"94dc90a5-c36a-4529-ad41-6bdfba5f04c3","From":"lod_kerenguisbert","ContentType":"text","Content":"I'm seeing intermittent failures in the auth flow e2e tests around token expiry: tests sometimes start within the 1ms before token validity window closes.

It is intended to guide implementation in the checkout-service-deployment job and ensure consistent reproduction across teams.The Compliance Enforcement stage is positioned in the Post-Test-Gates sequence and executes only after unit tests and integration tests have passed. It begins by assigning roles via the Role-based Authorization Strategy plugin to enforce least privilege deployment and remote access controls.Role definitions for least_privilege_deployer and remote_access_operator are declared in the Jenkinsfile using the plugin’s DSL. Permissions are bound to the checkout-service-deployment job folder so that only designated principals can invoke sensitive operations.The stage invokes the OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin against the liveoak/checkout-service:${params.VERSION}-canary container image with the FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02 profile. Upon completion, HTML and CSV reports are archived as build artifacts to provide detailed control-by-control results.Once the scan completes and artifacts are archived, a manual input gate is presented for the engineering-secpkg group to approve the findings. This gate enforces AC-17 policy sign-off and serves as a human checkpoint before production rollout.In the event of scan failures or high-severity findings, the stage triggers the feature-flag rollback logic automatically and sends a templated Slack alert to the #platform-planning channel with the summary of the failure and rollback initiation metric.This stage integrates with our LaunchDarkly feature flag framework by leveraging the retroactiveScan flag, ensuring that any deviation from compliance thresholds can be remediated through automatic rollbacks without requiring additional scripting.By standardizing the Compliance Enforcement stage in a dedicated Jenkins pipeline snippet, we reduce drift between teams and maintain alignment with regulatory requirements while preserving our continuous delivery velocity.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-20T14:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-23T14:55:00Z","FileId":"1469f74e-82ec-4454-abe6-7792c233fa47","FileLocation":"files\\devsecops_pipeline_design.docx","FileName":"devsecops_pipeline_design.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-23T14:55:00Z","Owner":"lod_danillec","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_sharij","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"s3://compliance/liveoak/2025-07-22/","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Detailed

The Secure Defaults and Vault Integration Guide builds on the recent changes introduced in PR #127 and #128 to illustrate an end-to-end workflow for substituting placeholder credentials with dynamic secret references in telemetry-config. The document describes how to configure the vaultSecretEngine YAML parameter to point to `vault://secret/data/ci/feature-flags#rollout-tokens` and enforce the `version:2` attribute as a mandatory field. It offers a complete example showing the correct indentation using two spaces per level, aligning with our YAML style guide, and demonstrates the automatic fallback to a secure default when the Jenkins pipeline variable DEPLOY_ENV is unset. The guide also highlights the corrected kebab-case naming convention for feature flags, such as `enable-feature-x`, and explains how these patterns are validated against our Confluence page at EngineeringDocuments/Standards/ConfigNamingConventions.To verify that secrets are retrieved correctly, the guide includes a snippet of the Jenkinsfile stage that invokes the Vault CLI to fetch the secret before rendering the final configuration. It outlines the integration test approach used in our staging environment, where the gRPC interceptor property `maxReceiveMessageSize: 1048576` is validated against a JSON Schema patch in telemetry-config-schema.json. Readers are directed to the Vault integration guide at SecurityTests/docs/VaultIntegration.md for detailed instructions on setting up the Vault KV engine and configuring access policies. The document concludes by suggesting a series of code review checkpoints—focused on indentation, naming conventions, schema validations, and secure defaults—that align with the newly added checklist section in the Configuration File Best Practices Confluence page. By following these recommendations, engineering teams can ensure that configuration artifacts remain both consistent and secure throughout the CI/CD lifecycle.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T17:05:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-24T10:00:00Z","FileId":"af38c57d-5071-4833-a25b-4d53c7331b54","FileLocation":"files\\Config_Standards_Review_Presentation.pptx","FileName":"Config_Standards_Review_Presentation.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-24T10:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_tisaodon","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_jasonadon","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/DevOps/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title  Config Standards Review: Outcomes and Next Steps  Presenter: Tisa Odonoghue (tisaodon), LiveOak DevOps  Date: 2025-07-24Slide 2: Agenda  • YAML Indentation and Naming Conventions  • Secure Default Values in Vault Integration  • JSON Schema Updates for gRPC Interceptor  • Infographic: Indentation Fix Impact  • Walkthrough: Config Change Log (see Config_Change_Log.xlsx)  • Demo: Secure Defaults and Vault Guide (see Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx)Slide 3: YAML Indentation and Naming Conventions  • Issue: Mixed tabs and spaces causing CI parser errors  • Resolution: Enforced two-space indentation across all config files  • Flag renames: camelCase → kebab-case (e.g., enable-feature-x)  • Files updated: alpha.yml (8 lines), beta.yml (6), gamma.yml (4), auth-config.yml (3)  • CI staging error rate dropped from 15% to 1%Slide 4: Infographic  [Embed: Indentation_Impact.png]  Caption: Indentation fixes vs. staging error reduction (bar chart)Slide 5: Secure Default Values in Vault Integration  • Added version:2 enforcement on vaultSecretEngine parameter  • Secure reference syntax: vault://secret/data/ci/feature-flags#rollout-tokens  • Code sample walkthrough (Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx)  • Link: https://liveoak.sharepoint.com/sites/devops/Shared%20Documents/DevOps/Guides/Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docxSlide 6: JSON Schema Updates for gRPC Interceptor  • PR #128: maxReceiveMessageSize added under properties.grpcInterceptor.properties  • Approval: terinahafen at 2025-07-23T16:30:00Z  • Schema file: configs/schema/telemetry-config-schema.json  • New CI stage: AJV validation in Jenkinsfile (ci-config branch)  • Next: add default and patternProperties per Jason’s feedbackSlide 7: Config Change Log Deep Dive  • Spreadsheet: Config_Change_Log.xlsx (Sheet: ConfigFileChangesDetails)  • Columns: Path, ChangeType, LinesAdded, PRNumber, Reviewers, MergeTime  • Example entry: auth-config.yml, PropertyAdd maxReceiveMessageSize, PR 128, merged 2025-07-23T16:30:00ZSlide 8: Next Steps & Action Items  • Add default 1048576 to JSON Schema (owner: jasonadon) – due 2025-07-25  • Extend schema to validate vault KV path (owner: jasonadon) – due 2025-07-26  • Complete AJV validation stage and bump pipeline (owner: tisaodon)  • Collect final feedback in 'Config-Standards-Review' Teams channel (@jasonadon, @bevmcg, @terinahafen)Slide 9: Q&A & Feedback  • Please comment in this deck or post questions in Teams #Config-Standards-Review  • Contact tisaodon@liveoakdigital.com for follow-up","TimeStamp":"2025-07-24T10:00:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"7684d4d3-01e0-48d8-b3a8-06a9ee1ae1d7","ChatType":"Group","ChatName":"Schema-Validation-Discussion","Members":["lod_jasonadon","lod_tisaodon","lod_eramanteca"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"866bc034-afa2-4d3f-aeee-b3ef6a50d2bb","From":"lod_jasonadon","ContentType":"text","Content":"Tisa, I’ve added \"default\":1048576 under maxReceiveMessageSize in telemetry-config-schema.json.

performance monitoring architecture implemented on July 23, 2025. It is authored by Ossie Ziller (Release Manager) from LiveOak Digital.1. End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline Architecture (Figure 1)[Image: pipeline_architecture_diagram.png]Caption: The full roadmap from code commit to artifact deployment. Highlights include the new \"performance-test\" stage placed after build and unit tests, and integration points with Prometheus and Grafana.2. Jenkins Performance-Test Stage Flow (Figure 2)[Image: performance_stage_flowchart.png]Caption: Detailed flow showing the Dockerized Node Exporter initialization, test harness execution, metrics scraping, and conditional PagerDuty alerting logic.3. Metrics Collection & Alerting Sequence (Figure 3)[Image: metrics_sequence_timeline.png]Caption: Timeline view illustrating 95th percentile latency capture, JSON log emission, ELK ingestion, and triggering of alerts when thresholds exceed 15% baseline.4. Grafana Dashboard Layout (Figure 4)[Image: grafana_dashboard_snapshot.png]Caption: Three-panel layout displaying 95th percentile latency, error rate heatmap, and GC pause duration. Environment variable selector allows switching between staging and production views.5.

Executive SummaryThis document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance our SDK Delivery Pipeline by integrating dynamic vulnerability thresholding based on CVSS v3.1 scores. Building on the recent SDK Delivery Pipeline Deep Dive held on July 24, 2025, we propose to evolve the existing medium-severity gate to support service-specific policies and manual override flags. The plan details new components, integration points with NVD, updates to Jenkins shared libraries, and modifications to Helm chart values. Our goal is to reduce false positives, accelerate promotions, and maintain alignment with LiveOak Digital security standards.2. Background and ContextDuring the July 23 maintenance session, we introduced a fixed MEDIUM severity threshold in the Trivy scan stage. On July 24, the deep dive workshop surfaced requirements for a more granular policy that maps each CVE to its CVSS base score and allows dynamic thresholds per service component. Current limitations include sequential NVD lookups without caching, lack of threshold overrides, and Helm chart values hardcoded to a single image tag. This plan addresses these gaps and provides a roadmap for incremental delivery.[Page 2 of 4]3. Objectives and ScopeThe primary objectives are:- Develop a CVSS v3.1 Mapping Module in the Jenkins pipeline shared library.- Integrate an NVD API client with retry, caching, and parallel lookup support.- Extend the pipeline DSL to read threshold configurations from charts/sdk-java/values.yaml.- Implement manual override flags for non-critical CVEs (CVSS <5.0).- Update Helm chart templates to consume dynamic threshold values and image tags.Out of scope:- Upstream changes to third-party libraries beyond the CI pipeline.- Non-Java SDK projects (to be addressed in subsequent phases).4. Proposed Architecture and Design4.1 CVSS v3.1 Mapping ModuleWe will introduce a new Groovy class `CvssMapper` in `pipeline-shared@1.3.0` that accepts a list of CVE identifiers and returns a map of CVE to base score. The module will leverage thread pools for parallel HTTP GET requests to the NVD restful endpoint and maintain an in-memory synchronized cache for session-level deduplication.4.2 NVD API Integration LayerThe `NvdClient` component encapsulates token-based authentication, exponential backoff on HTTP 429, and JSON parsing. It will expose methods:```groovyMap<String,Float> lookupBatch(List<String> cves)```which returns CVSS base scores. We will test this client with unit tests in `pipeline-shared/src/test/groovy/CvssMapperSpec.groovy` using mocked HTTP responses.4.3 Dynamic Threshold ConfigurationChart values in `charts/sdk-java/values.yaml` will gain a new section:```yamltrivyThresholds:  defaultMaxScore: 5.0  overrides:    inventory-service: 4.5    orders-service: 5.5```The pipeline will read these values at runtime via `withCredentials` and `readYaml` steps. Images tagged `liveoak/sdk-java:${IMAGE_TAG}` will adopt thresholds based on service context.[Page 3 of 4]5.

This paper investigates the design, implementation, and evaluation of an adaptive LRU cache resizing mechanism based on miss-rate thresholds and real-time telemetry in a high-throughput Kafka consumer service.1. IntroductionModern stream processing systems often rely on in-memory caches to accelerate authentication and message routing. Static cache configurations fail to accommodate sudden surges in request volume, leading to increased eviction cycles and latency spikes (Smith et al., 2019). Our engineering team at LiveOak Digital observed intermittent kafka_consumer_group_lag spikes under sustained 5k msg/sec loads and developed a dynamic resizing proposal to address these issues.2. Background and Related WorkDynamic cache management has been explored in web applications (Doe and Roe, 2020) and database systems (Johnson and Lee, 2018). However, its application within real-time Kafka consumer contexts remains under-studied. Prior studies (Miller et al., 2021) demonstrate the benefits of miss-rate-driven policies, but lack integration with CI telemetry pipelines.3. System Model and RequirementsWe define the cache state C(n) with capacity n, and measure miss rate m over a sliding window w. The resizing controller triggers an increase delta when m > μ for a duration τ (LiveOak Digital, 2025). Requirements include avoiding oscillations, bounding maximum capacity, and ensuring sub-3ms p95 latency for jwt_validation.4. Implementation Details4.1 ArchitectureThe cache component integrates with Micrometer for metric emission. Recording rules tag p95 latency by phase and environment (unit-test, smoke-test, canary). The controller runs in a dedicated scheduler thread and applies size adjustments via JMX hooks.4.2 Configurationdynamic_cache_settings.yaml defines parameters: maxCap, maxGrow, stabilityWindow, cooldownMs, and missThreshold. Example:  cacheSettings:    maxCap: 512    maxGrow: 75    stabilityWindow: 3m    cooldownMs: 600000    missThreshold: 0.014.3 Spring Boot IntegrationProperties bind to @ConfigurationProperties(prefix='auth.cache'), enabling external overrides in staging and production profiles.5. Experimental Evaluation5.1 Test SetupWe deployed a Minikube cluster with mockAuthService stub and JMeter-driven 8k msg/sec load. Metrics collected over 30-minute canary runs.5.2 ResultsTable 1 shows eviction events, cache sizes, and latencies. Dynamic resizing engaged twice, maintaining p95 <3ms. Comparative tests with static caches of 256 and 512 entries exhibited 25% higher latency and 40% more eviction cycles.6. DiscussionDynamic resizing reduces manual tuning and adapts to workload fluctuations. Proper cooldown durations prevent thrashing. Integration with CI telemetry ensures early detection of regressions (García et al., 2022).7. Conclusion and Future WorkOur adaptive cache controller significantly improves end-to-end streaming reliability. Future research will explore predictive resize models using time-series forecasting and extend the approach to multi-tenant consumer groups.References[1] Smith, A., Kumar, P.

Key enhancements: a static ThreadPoolExecutor of size 4 feeds `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync` calls for each CVE, backed by a ConcurrentHashMap cache to dedupe lookups. The `fetchScoreWithRetries(cve)` helper handles HTTP 429 responses with exponential backoff (starting at 500 ms, doubling each retry with random jitter, capped at 5 attempts). After gathering results, we zip CVE IDs with their base scores and call `error(\"CVSS threshold breached: ${violations}\")` if any score ≥ maxScore.

We introduce an LRU-based cache pre-warming technique and evaluate its effectiveness in both microbenchmark and production environments.Keywords: JWT, LRU cache, performance optimization, authentication latency1. IntroductionSecure, low-latency authentication remains critical in modern distributed applications. JWTs [1] offer a compact, URL-safe mechanism for conveying user claims, but signature verification can introduce significant overhead under high load. In our LiveOak Digital authentication service, we observed 15% of requests exceeding a 200 ms threshold due to synchronous file I/O on public key lookups. This paper explores an optimized cache design to mitigate such latency spikes and maintain SLA compliance.Page 22. Background2.1 JSON Web Token VerificationJWT signature verification involves parsing the token header, decoding the payload, and cryptographically verifying the signature against a known public key [1]. Cache misses can trigger disk reads or remote key fetches, degrading performance.2.2 Related WorkSmith et al. [2] demonstrated up to 40% latency reduction by introducing in-memory lookup caches for symmetric keys. Doe [3] evaluated LRU cache hit rates under various eviction policies, noting a 5% miss rate at scale. Our work extends these findings by focusing on asynchronous pre-warming and microbenchmark integration into CI pipelines.Page 33. Caching Methodology3.1 LRU Cache DesignWe implemented a thread-safe LRU cache that preloads all active public keys at service startup, eliminating synchronous file I/O on verification paths. The cache uses a fixed capacity of 256 entries and supports forced cache expiration to simulate eviction scenarios.3.2 CI Pipeline IntegrationNew microbenchmark tests in auth_service/tests/test_jwt_cache_perf.py measure average verification latency over 1,000 iterations. A performance regression check fails the build if average latency exceeds 3 ms, ensuring long-term stability.Page 44. Performance Evaluation4.1 Experimental SetupBenchmarks were executed on a 16-core Azure VM (DS4_v2) with New Relic agent instrumentation. Warm cache tests begin after service startup; cold cache tests clear the cache before each run.4.2 ResultsWarm cache average latency dropped from 8 ms to 1.2 ms (σ=0.3 ms). Cold cache scenario average latency was 4.5 ms (σ=0.7 ms), with hit rate sustained above 99.5% [4]. CPU usage stabilized from peaks of 80% down to 50% under 10,000 RPS load.Page 55. DiscussionThe pre-warming approach effectively eliminates disk I/O on the critical path, aligning with best practices for high-performance services. Forced expiration tests confirm graceful degradation: even with 10% forced misses, average latency remains below the CI threshold of 3 ms.6. ConclusionImplementing an LRU pre-warming cache and integrating performance regression checks into CI yields substantial latency improvements and robust SLA compliance. Future work includes dynamic cache resizing and real-time cache health monitoring.Page 6References[1] Jones, M. et al. (2015). RFC 7519: JSON Web Token (JWT).

It outlines architecture diagrams, sequence flows, configuration schemas, and integration points necessary to adopt adaptive cache resizing for production readiness.Section 2: Static Cache Baseline2.1 Overview of Static LRU Cache  - Preloads 256 public keys at service startup to eliminate disk I/O on cache hits.  - Evicts least-recently-used entries when capacity is reached.  - Monitors cache hit/miss metrics via Prometheus.Figure 1: Static Cache Flow Diagram[Image: Cache_Architecture_Diagram illustrating key preload, lookup, and eviction paths]Section 3: Dynamic Resizing Extension3.1 Design Goals  - Automatically adjust cache capacity based on operational metrics.  - Prevent unexpected latency spikes due to forced eviction under load.  - Maintain memory efficiency by shrinking cache during low-load periods.3.2 Metrics and Triggers  - jwt_cache_current_size: Gauge reflecting current cache capacity.  - jwt_cache_hit_total, jwt_cache_miss_total: Counters to compute miss-rate.  - CPU utilization threshold: evaluated via service telemetry.3.3 Resize Rules  - Upsize Condition: miss_rate > 1% sustained over 5 minutes    Action: increase capacity by 50 entries, up to max 512    Cooldown: 10 minutes  - Downsize Condition: CPU > 70% and hit_rate > 99% over 5 minutes    Action: decrease capacity by 25 entries, down to min 128    Cooldown: 10 minutesFigure 2: Dynamic Resizing Sequence Diagram[Image: Sequence_Diagram illustrating metric evaluation, rule engine, and cache adjustment]Section 4: Configuration SchemaThe following YAML schema defines the dynamic resize sections in auth_service/config/cache_settings.yaml:```yamlresize:  miss_threshold: 0.01  cpu_threshold: 0.7  up_size: 50  down_size: 25  min_capacity: 128  max_capacity: 512  evaluation_window: 5m  cooldown_period: 10m```Figure 3: Configuration Screenshot[Image: Screenshot of cache_settings.yaml with highlighted parameters]Section 5: Integration and Visualization5.1 Prometheus Recording Rules  - jwt_cache_resize_events_total: Counter for resize operations  - Alert: More than 3 resize events in 10 minutes triggers a warning5.2 Grafana Panels  - Panel 1: Cache Capacity Over Time  - Panel 2: Miss Rate vs. Capacity  - Panel 3: CPU Utilization and Hit RateFigure 4: Grafana Dashboard Mockup[Image: Mockup image showing panels for capacity, miss rate, CPU, hit rate]Section 6: Sequence of Operations1. Metrics Collector polls Prometheus every 30s2. Rule Engine evaluates conditions based on sliding windows3. If trigger met and cooldown elapsed, Resizer updates capacity4. CacheManager applies new capacity and emits event5. Monitoring and alerting reflect changes in real-timeSection 7: ConclusionDynamic resizing enhances the resilience and performance of our authentication service by adapting cache capacity to traffic patterns. This guide should serve as a reference for implementation, configuration, and operational monitoring to maintain sub-200ms JWT verification latency under varying load conditions.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-26T09:15:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-24T12:15:00Z","FileId":"7214cbee-bfdb-457b-8576-b7ef96d521d4","FileLocation":"files\\JWT_Cache_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","FileName":"JWT_Cache_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-24T12:15:00Z","Owner":"lod_nilatanguma","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_tonycool","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_porshab","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Deep Dive into JWT Cache PerformanceParagraph: This slide summarizes microbenchmark and production metrics for the JWT LRU cache.

By integrating real-time telemetry and a threshold-driven controller, we ensure that cache capacity adapts automatically to workload fluctuations, maintaining sub-3 ms p95 jwt_validation_latency and preventing backpressure in the streaming pipeline.Design and Implementation:At service startup, the LRU cache preloads active public keys, eliminating synchronous disk I/O on misses. The resize controller monitors the miss-rate metric (jwt_cache_miss_rate) over a sliding window (stabilityWindow) and triggers capacity increases of maxGrow entries when the miss rate exceeds missThreshold. Each resize action is subject to a cooldown (cooldownMs) to prevent oscillations. Metrics are emitted via Micrometer and collected by Prometheus, with recording rules tagged by phase (unit-test, smoke-test, canary) and environment (staging).Configuration Parameters:The dynamic_cache_settings.yaml file defines key parameters: maxCap: 512 (upper bound), maxGrow: 75 (entries per resize), stabilityWindow: 3m (miss-rate evaluation window), cooldownMs: 600000 (10-minute interval between resizes), and missThreshold: 0.01 (1% miss rate trigger). These defaults have been validated in staging canary runs at 8k msg/sec, showing two resize events with stable latencies and zero OOM events.Next Steps:We recommend integrating the dynamic resizing health check into the incident runbook and adding a Prometheus alert (CacheResizeMissThresholdBreached) to flag sustained miss-rate breaches. Additionally, updating the CI pipeline templates to parameterize missThreshold values will enable us to test boundary scenarios automatically. Production rollout is scheduled for 2025-07-30, with final verification via Grafana dashboards featuring interactive phase and environment filters.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-26T09:00:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"123 LiveOak Way"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Shakia Gencarelli","FirstName":"Shakia","JobTitle":"Senior Software Engineer","LastName":"Gencarelli","MailNickName":"lod_shakiag","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2749","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"654 Cedar Street"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Emory Scherping","FirstName":"Emory","JobTitle":"DevOps Engineer","LastName":"Scherping","MailNickName":"lod_emorys","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2834","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"987 Willow Brook Path"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Era Manteca","FirstName":"Era","JobTitle":"Software Engineer","LastName":"Manteca","MailNickName":"lod_eramanteca","Manager":"lod_shakiag","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2822","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"555 Larchmont Road"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Markita Sitra","FirstName":"Markita","JobTitle":"DevOps Engineer","LastName":"Sitra","MailNickName":"lod_markitas","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3715","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"852 Oak Meadow Court"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Rufina Ganie","FirstName":"Rufina","JobTitle":"Software Engineer","LastName":"Ganie","MailNickName":"lod_rufinag","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2661","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

Angular Admin Dashboard UI Integration Test Session OutcomesPresenter: Danille CiardulloDate: 2025-07-24Slide 1: Objectives• Review enhancements to authentication stubbing and role-based login flows• Analyze 502 error root causes and retry logic efficacy• Illustrate checkout flow mapping against Figma designs• Summarize execution metrics and coverage gains• Outline best practices and next steps for CI integrationSlide 2: Authentication Stub Enhancements• Sequence diagram infographic (see UI_Integration_Test_Flow_Diagram.pdf, FileId:601773b2-c03d-4d90-b97a-57a348778d16)• Cypress cy.intercept configured in cypress/support/index.js for new roles claim• MockAuth utility updated to generate dynamic JWTs per user profileSlide 3: 502 Error Root Cause Analysis• Bar chart: 502 error rate vs. concurrent user load in staging• Diagnosed missing timeout parameter in axios HTTP client (httpClient.ts)• Patch applied: timeout: 5000ms, validated via tracing Node.js logs (service/product-service/logs/2025-07-22.log)Slide 4: Retry Logic Efficacy• Negative test summary: test/integration/order-failure.spec.ts simulating backend timeout• Line chart: retry attempts vs. failure count (3 attempts)• Validation: assertion confirms retry logic triggers exactly three times before errorSlide 5: Checkout Flow Mapping• Infographic: Figma .btn-checkout & .nav-cart components vs. Cypress selectors• Fixture analytics payload structure linked to checkout-analytics.json• Screenshot comparison: Figma mockup vs. live DOM assertionsSlide 6: Execution Metrics & Coverage• Donut chart: 48 specs executed in 68 seconds, 92% frontend-backend contract coverage• CI job screenshot: GitLab pipeline run for branch feature/ui-integrationSlide 7: Best Practices & Recommendations• Test isolation: reset auth state in beforeEach hooks to prevent cross-test pollution• Branching strategy: feature/ui-integration workflow, GitLab CI triggering Jenkins integration job• Documentation: updated Confluence page under docs/ci/integration-testingSlide 8: Next Steps• Integrate new specs into nightly pipeline (ticket assigned to Danille Ciardullo)• Instrument pass/fail metrics in

Approve PR #492/493 in monitoring-utils repo to merge updated Grafana rules and Alertmanager config.2. Schedule production canary on August 1 with a 20-minute verification window; monitor using Integrated_Observability_Contract_Metrics_Dashboard.xlsx.3. Incorporate dynamic threshold tuning: explore adaptive latency baselines based on historical k6 traffic patterns.4. Extend Metricbeat parsers to additional services (svc-pay, svc-auth) for end-to-end ECS compliance.5.

Unlike prior studies that treat chaos and security validation in isolation [1][2], we examine their interplay under sustained 5,000 RPS load and multi-vector fault injection. We detail experiment design, monitoring pipeline validation, Prometheus alert tuning, and vulnerability scanning integration with OWASP ZAP and Trivy. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of combined resilience and security workflows in reducing mean time to detection (MTTD) and ensuring no critical vulnerabilities slip through during fault-induced container rebuilds.1. IntroductionChaos engineering has emerged as a critical practice for validating system reliability under adverse conditions [3]. Concurrently, continuous security assessments ensure software integrity against emerging threats [4]. However, integrating these disciplines within a unified exercise remains under-explored. LiveOak Digital’s two-day initiative targeted the /v1/transactions endpoint with CPU burn, network latency, and pod termination scenarios orchestrated via Gremlin and Chaos Monkey. Security scans were performed on baseline and post-chaos containers to detect regression in vulnerability posture [5]. This paper documents our methodology, metrics, and actionable insights.2. Experimental Design2.1 Workload and Fault InjectionWe sustained a 5,000 RPS load against payments-api using Locust 2.0 [6]. Faults included 90% CPU utilization on 2 of 3 pods for 60s, 200 ms downstream latency to fraud-detection, and random pod kills every 45–75s. Experiments ran in two shifts coordinated by Terina Hafen and Keren Guisbert, with Ashley Engel validating harness stability.2.2 Monitoring Pipeline ValidationPrometheus recording rules for histogram_quantile(0.95) were deployed, accompanied by an anomaly detection rule: increase(http_request_errors_total[5m]) / increase(http_request_total[5m]) > 0.01. Grafana dashboards were updated with separate rows for CPU and network faults, P95 latency panels, and error-rate heatmaps. Alert thresholds were set to trigger PagerDuty at >1.2 s P95 latency and Jira tickets for >1% error rate.2.3 Security ScanningWe executed Trivy JSON scans and OWASP ZAP active scans pre- and post-chaos. Vulnerabilities were aggregated by severity. No critical or high CVEs emerged, while 14 medium CVEs in transitive dependencies were identified post-chaos. Scan data informed remediation recommendations integrated into Jenkins pipelines via declarative DSL snippets [7].3. Results3.1 Latency and Error-Rate BehaviorP95 latency peaked at 1.52 s under CPU burn (exceeding the 1.2 s threshold), while network latency alone produced 1.2 s peaks. The anomaly rule fired within 30s of error spikes, opening Jira ticket SEC-501 and PagerDuty incidents as designed. Improved threshold at 1.5 s reduced false positives during CPU fault windows.3.2 Vulnerability PostureBaseline Trivy scans found zero critical/high CVEs. Post-chaos container rebuilding introduced no new critical findings, confirming image remediation processes. Medium CVEs decreased from 14 to 0 after dependency upgrades to versions 2.1.0 and 4.5.2.3.3 Workflow OutcomesCombined chaos and security exercises reduced MTTD by 40% compared to separate drills. Automated PromQL snippets with fault_type templating improved alert precision. On-call simulations validated runbook links and Grafana snapshot integration.4. DiscussionOur hybrid approach aligns with emerging best practices for DevSecOps [8]. Key recommendations include:- Use template variables (fault_type, pod) in PromQL to isolate metric contexts and apply differential thresholds [9].- Integrate Trivy and ZAP outputs into CI/CD gates to enforce quality controls immediately after chaos runs.- Maintain consolidated documentation (e.g., Planning Document 271b80e9-e1b6-4774-a92e-c5c31298b7ba) to track action items, responsibilities, and timelines.5. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that orchestrating chaos engineering and security assessments in tandem enhances resilience and vulnerability visibility without introducing new risks. LiveOak Digital’s exercise confirmed alert rule robustness, dashboard clarity, and a zero critical CVE outcome, guiding a unified framework applicable across microservice architectures.References[1] Basiri, A., et al., \"Chaos Engineering Principles and Practices,\" IEEE Software, 2020.[2] Fowler, M., \"The State of Chaos Engineering 2019,\" Gremlin Inc., 2019.[3] Tucker, B., \"Site Reliability through Experimentation,\" O’Reilly Media, 2021.[4] OWASP Foundation, \"OWASP ZAP User Guide,\" 2021.[5] Gencarelli, S., \"Security Assessment Report: Payments-API Chaos Exercise,\" LiveOak Digital Internal Document, 2025.[6] Iyer, R. and Verma, P., \"Scalable Load Testing with Locust,\" SRECon, 2022.[7] Alaggia, M. and Fraser, H., \"Automating Security Gates in Jenkins Pipelines,\" DevSecOps Journal, 2023.[8] Williams, C., \"Bridging DevOps and Security: A Unified Approach,\" ACM DevSecOps, 2024.[9] Hafen, T. and Guisbert, K., \"Template-Driven PromQL for Multi-Fault Analysis,\" LiveOak Digital Workshop, 2025.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-10T09:00:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"123 LiveOak Way"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Shakia Gencarelli","FirstName":"Shakia","JobTitle":"Senior Software Engineer","LastName":"Gencarelli","MailNickName":"lod_shakiag","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2749","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"987 Elm Street"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Ossie Ziller","FirstName":"Ossie","JobTitle":"Release Manager","LastName":"Ziller","MailNickName":"lod_oziller","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2777","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"158 Willow Creek Drive"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Solutions Architecture","DisplayName":"Shari Jatho","FirstName":"Shari","JobTitle":"Solutions Architect","LastName":"Jatho","MailNickName":"lod_sharij","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2837","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"987 Willow Brook Path"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Era Manteca","FirstName":"Era","JobTitle":"Software Engineer","LastName":"Manteca","MailNickName":"lod_eramanteca","Manager":"lod_shakiag","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2822","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Cypress Court"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Sau Alquesta","FirstName":"Sau","JobTitle":"Platform Technical Lead","LastName":"Alquesta","MailNickName":"lod_saulq","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3012","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"200 Sycamore Street"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Product","DisplayName":"Tony Coolbrith","FirstName":"Tony","JobTitle":"Product Manager","LastName":"Coolbrith","MailNickName":"lod_tonycool","Manager":null,"OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2800","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Cypress Lane"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Cortez Dehn","FirstName":"Cortez","JobTitle":"DevOps Engineer","LastName":"Dehn","MailNickName":"lod_cortezdehn","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3098","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

It is intended to guide implementation in the checkout-service-deployment job and ensure consistent reproduction across teams.The Compliance Enforcement stage is positioned in the Post-Test-Gates sequence and executes only after unit tests and integration tests have passed. It begins by assigning roles via the Role-based Authorization Strategy plugin to enforce least privilege deployment and remote access controls.Role definitions for least_privilege_deployer and remote_access_operator are declared in the Jenkinsfile using the plugin’s DSL. Permissions are bound to the checkout-service-deployment job folder so that only designated principals can invoke sensitive operations.The stage invokes the OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin against the liveoak/checkout-service:${params.VERSION}-canary container image with the FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02 profile. Upon completion, HTML and CSV reports are archived as build artifacts to provide detailed control-by-control results.Once the scan completes and artifacts are archived, a manual input gate is presented for the engineering-secpkg group to approve the findings. This gate enforces AC-17 policy sign-off and serves as a human checkpoint before production rollout.In the event of scan failures or high-severity findings, the stage triggers the feature-flag rollback logic automatically and sends a templated Slack alert to the #platform-planning channel with the summary of the failure and rollback initiation metric.This stage integrates with our LaunchDarkly feature flag framework by leveraging the retroactiveScan flag, ensuring that any deviation from compliance thresholds can be remediated through automatic rollbacks without requiring additional scripting.By standardizing the Compliance Enforcement stage in a dedicated Jenkins pipeline snippet, we reduce drift between teams and maintain alignment with regulatory requirements while preserving our continuous delivery velocity.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-20T14:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-20T13:15:00Z","FileId":"501dfdf6-1fa3-4a71-92da-7a4e13f9119e","FileLocation":"files\\FeatureFlag_Rollout_Strategy_Details.docx","FileName":"FeatureFlag_Rollout_Strategy_Details.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-20T13:15:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saturninasoyke","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Docs","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Deep Dive: Controlled Feature-Flag Rollout and A/B Testing Strategy for Checkout APIThis document provides a detailed examination of the controlled rollout approach we developed to address the performance regression in the customer checkout service. It expands on the two feature flags ‘‘checkout_sql_batch_enabled’’ and ‘‘hibernate_query_cache_enabled’’ defined in our LaunchDarkly workspace, elaborating on how these flags were integrated into our continuous delivery pipeline via Helm and environment-variable wrappers. By outlining the precise mechanics of flag injection and the Helm-values configuration in vars/featureFlags.groovy, we intend to share the technical patterns that enabled a seamless switch between the legacy and optimized code paths without full redeploys, preserving service stability under peak load.The integration of these flags into our Kubernetes deployments leverages our shared Jenkins library, which was updated to accept flag values at build time. The pipeline now passes ‘‘checkout_sql_batch_enabled’’ and ‘‘hibernate_query_cache_enabled’’ as environment variables in the container spec, using --set override flags in the Helm release command. This design allows us to perform a canary deployment by toggling flag values against a specific canary instance of checkout-service:v1.2.3-canary. We maintain consistent naming conventions for the flags and reference them in the deployment chart’s values.yaml to avoid drift between staging and production environments.Our A/B testing methodology executes in two phases. The first phase directs 5 percent of incoming traffic to the canary instance for three hours, during which we collect P95 latency, error-rate, and deadlock counts via Prometheus histograms and custom JProfiler metrics published through Micrometer. We established performance thresholds of P95 latency below 200 milliseconds and maximum CPU utilization under 70 percent. Grafana dashboards were configured to automatically refresh every 30 seconds, providing near‐real-time visibility into histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{flag=~\"batchEnabled|cacheEnabled\"}[1m])) by (le)). Following successful validation at 5 percent, we amplify the canary slice to 50 percent traffic and re‐evaluate for another three-hour window.To mitigate risk, we defined precise progression criteria and rollback contingencies. Should P95 latency exceed our SLA or if any SQLExceptions indicating new deadlocks appear in the application logs, the Jenkins pipeline invokes a built-in rollback stage that flips the flags back to ‘‘false’’ and automatically triggers helm rollback for the canary release. We also added a manual approval gate prior to the 100 percent enablement step, ensuring sign-off from Security, QA, and Product stakeholders via an input step that references the OpenSCAP scan report archived as build artifacts.Next steps include finalizing the Confluence page in EngineeringDocuments space with code snippets, pipeline screenshots, and a link to this detailed strategy doc. We will convene a cross-functional review on July 22 to confirm the rollout timeline and to synchronize on the production canary launch. All artifacts, including the updated Jenkinsfile, Helm chart overrides, and Grafana dashboard JSON, are attached as linked files in our shared repository for traceability and audit compliance.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-20T13:15:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-21T13:00:00Z","FileId":"6833cd0b-5417-4300-a0c4-24a4525abdf2","FileLocation":"files\\Checkout_Canary_Rollout_and_Compliance_Dashboard.xlsx","FileName":"Checkout_Canary_Rollout_and_Compliance_Dashboard.xlsx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-21T13:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_danillec","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_saturninasoyke","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_rufinag","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Sheets","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Sheet: TrafficSliceMetrics:TrafficSlice,StartTime,EndTime,P95Latency_ms,MaxCPU_%,Deadlocks,ErrorRate_%5%,2025-07-17T15:00:00Z,2025-07-17T18:00:00Z,160,65,0,0.0525%,2025-07-18T09:00:00Z,2025-07-18T15:00:00Z,155,63,0,0.0450%,2025-07-19T09:00:00Z,2025-07-19T13:00:00Z,150,60,0,0.03Sheet: ComplianceGatePassRates:Stage,GateType,RequiredApprovals,ApprovalsObtained,Status,CommentsOpenSCAP Scan,Automated,0,0,Pass,No high-severity failuresManual Signoff,Security+QA,2,2,Pass,Security and QA approvedLiquibase Audit,Automated,0,0,Pending,Awaiting Rufina reviewFinal Signoff,Security+QA+Product,3,2,In Progress,Product signoff scheduledSheet: PipelineStageTimings:Stage,Duration_ms,Passed,NotesCanary Pre-Check,120000,Pass,Cold and warm P95 under thresholdsA/B Test Execution,10800000,Pass,Completed 5% and 25% slicesCompliance Enforcement,2400000,Pass,OpenSCAP and role bindingLiquibase Audit Enforcement,600000,Pass,Pre-flight migration annotations checkedSheet: ApprovalSignOffMatrix:Role,ApproverGroup,Members,SignoffTimestamp,StatusSecurity,engineering-secpkg,nilatanguma;saturninasoyke;wilfordt,2025-07-19T17:30:00Z,ApprovedQA,platform-qateam,emorys;tisaodon,2025-07-20T10:00:00Z,ApprovedProduct,platform-product,saturninasoyke,2025-07-20T12:00:00Z,Pending","TimeStamp":"2025-07-21T13:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-21T11:30:00Z","FileId":"20f869f9-cb03-45f3-8740-3728d5dad6d2","FileLocation":"files\\Compliance_Enforcement_DeepDive.pptx","FileName":"Compliance_Enforcement_DeepDive.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-21T11:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_saturninasoyke","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title SlideTitle: Compliance Enforcement Deep DiveSubtitle: Integrating FedRAMP Controls into CI/CD PipelinePresenter: Saturnina Soyke, Director of Platform EngineeringDate: July 21, 2025Slide 2: Agenda- Introduction & Objectives- CI/CD Pipeline Overview- Role-Based Authorization Integration- OpenSCAP Compliance Stage- Metrics & Monitoring Dashboards- Automated Rollback Logic- Live Demonstration- Next Steps & Timeline- Q&ASlide 3: CI/CD Pipeline OverviewDescription: High-level flow from code commit to production rollout, illustrating build, test, canary, compliance, audit, and sign-off stages.Image: pipeline_architecture_diagram.png (alt text: Diagram showing Jenkins pipeline stages with labeled compliance gate between A/B tests and final promotion)Slide 4: Role-Based Authorization (RBA)Details:• Enforce least-privilege for deployment• Define roles: least_privilege_deployer, remote_access_operator• Bind permissions using Role-based Authorization Strategy pluginCode Snippet Preview:```roles {  least_privilege_deployer {    permissions: [JOB_READ, JOB_BUILD]  }  remote_access_operator {    permissions: [HOST_CONNECT]  }}``` Image: rba_configuration_snippet.png (alt text: Jenkinsfile snippet defining RBA roles)Slide 5: OpenSCAP Compliance StageDescription:• Invokes OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin against canary image• Uses FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02 profile• Archives HTML & CSV reports as build artifactsCode Snippet Preview:```openscap 'FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02'archiveArtifacts 'compliance-report.html','compliance-summary.csv'``` Slide 6: Metrics & MonitoringDescription:• Dashboard tracks compliance pass rates, approval status, P95 latencies• Prometheus & Grafana integrationImage: compliance_metrics_dashboard.png (alt text: Grafana dashboard showing pass rates and P95 latency trends)Slide 7: Automated Rollback LogicDescription:• Feature flag 'retroactiveScan' toggles rollback stage• Triggers rollback on scan failure or high-severity findingsFlow:1.

We detail methodologies for identifying N+1 query defects [1], designing controlled A/B tests for feature-flag rollouts [2], and integrating OpenSCAP-based security scans into a declarative Jenkins pipeline [3]. Our contributions include performance profiling patterns, rollout criteria design, and compliance enforcement blueprints, accompanied by empirical results demonstrating P95 latency improvements from 350 ms to 150 ms and zero SQL deadlocks under high load.1. IntroductionHigh-throughput e-commerce platforms face critical challenges when performance regressions coincide with stringent regulatory controls. In July 2025, the LiveOak Digital platform encountered a 30 percent increase in checkout P95 latency and intermittent SQL deadlocks during peak traffic. As part of the Platform Engineering group, we embarked on a multi-step remediation that combined deep performance analysis with automated compliance validation. This study codifies our approach and lessons learned, contributing to best practices for performance-compliance co-engineering in microservices.2. Performance Profiling MethodologyWe employed dynamic instrumentation via JProfiler and Micrometer histograms [4] to capture full-stack flamegraphs of the payment validation module. Bottleneck analysis identified an N+1 query against the orders table exacerbated by Hibernate cache eviction patterns. We drafted performance test cases with target thresholds (P95 < 200 ms, CPU < 70 percent) and executed A/B comparisons under LaunchDarkly feature flags “checkout_sql_batch_enabled” and “hibernate_query_cache_enabled”. Metrics collection used Prometheus pulls at 30s intervals, aligning with Grafana dashboards for real-time visibility [5].3. Feature Flag Rollout DesignOur rollout strategy defined two phases: a 5 percent traffic slice for 3 hours and a subsequent 50 percent slice pending SLA validation. We automated flag injection via Helm values in the Kubernetes deployment and validated end-to-end latency, error rates, and deadlock counts at each checkpoint. Empirical data showed a P95 drop from 350 ms to 160 ms in the canary slice, enabling safe progression criteria.4. Compliance Enforcement IntegrationTo satisfy FedRAMP Rev 5 controls AC-17 (Remote Access) and SC-02 (Least Privilege), we integrated an OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin stage in the Post-Test-Gates of our pipeline [3]. We defined Role-Based Authorization Strategy roles (least_privilege_deployer, remote_access_operator) to scope permissions, invoked OpenSCAP scans against container images for TLS 1.2+ FIPS-validated cipher suites, and paused for manual security/QE sign-off via an input gate. Fail-fast rollback logic was implemented to trigger feature-flag reversion upon scan failures.5. Results and DiscussionCombined performance tuning and compliance automation yielded P95 latency of 150 ms, CPU max of 60 percent, and zero deadlocks over multi-hour test windows. The integrated pipeline ensured security controls did not impair performance delivery. Key insights include the importance of systematic histograms for real-time decision making [4], and the utility of feature flags as rollback-safe delivery mechanisms [2].6. ConclusionOur case study demonstrates that cohesive engineering processes can reconcile high-performance requirements with stringent compliance mandates. By coupling precise profiling, controlled feature-flag rollouts, and automated security gating, teams can achieve both performance and security objectives without bottlenecking delivery velocity.References[1] A.

It is intended to guide implementation in the checkout-service-deployment job and ensure consistent reproduction across teams.The Compliance Enforcement stage is positioned in the Post-Test-Gates sequence and executes only after unit tests and integration tests have passed. It begins by assigning roles via the Role-based Authorization Strategy plugin to enforce least privilege deployment and remote access controls.Role definitions for least_privilege_deployer and remote_access_operator are declared in the Jenkinsfile using the plugin’s DSL. Permissions are bound to the checkout-service-deployment job folder so that only designated principals can invoke sensitive operations.The stage invokes the OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin against the liveoak/checkout-service:${params.VERSION}-canary container image with the FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02 profile. Upon completion, HTML and CSV reports are archived as build artifacts to provide detailed control-by-control results.Once the scan completes and artifacts are archived, a manual input gate is presented for the engineering-secpkg group to approve the findings. This gate enforces AC-17 policy sign-off and serves as a human checkpoint before production rollout.In the event of scan failures or high-severity findings, the stage triggers the feature-flag rollback logic automatically and sends a templated Slack alert to the #platform-planning channel with the summary of the failure and rollback initiation metric.This stage integrates with our LaunchDarkly feature flag framework by leveraging the retroactiveScan flag, ensuring that any deviation from compliance thresholds can be remediated through automatic rollbacks without requiring additional scripting.By standardizing the Compliance Enforcement stage in a dedicated Jenkins pipeline snippet, we reduce drift between teams and maintain alignment with regulatory requirements while preserving our continuous delivery velocity.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-20T14:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-21T11:30:00Z","FileId":"20f869f9-cb03-45f3-8740-3728d5dad6d2","FileLocation":"files\\Compliance_Enforcement_DeepDive.pptx","FileName":"Compliance_Enforcement_DeepDive.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-21T11:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_saturninasoyke","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title SlideTitle: Compliance Enforcement Deep DiveSubtitle: Integrating FedRAMP Controls into CI/CD PipelinePresenter: Saturnina Soyke, Director of Platform EngineeringDate: July 21, 2025Slide 2: Agenda- Introduction & Objectives- CI/CD Pipeline Overview- Role-Based Authorization Integration- OpenSCAP Compliance Stage- Metrics & Monitoring Dashboards- Automated Rollback Logic- Live Demonstration- Next Steps & Timeline- Q&ASlide 3: CI/CD Pipeline OverviewDescription: High-level flow from code commit to production rollout, illustrating build, test, canary, compliance, audit, and sign-off stages.Image: pipeline_architecture_diagram.png (alt text: Diagram showing Jenkins pipeline stages with labeled compliance gate between A/B tests and final promotion)Slide 4: Role-Based Authorization (RBA)Details:• Enforce least-privilege for deployment• Define roles: least_privilege_deployer, remote_access_operator• Bind permissions using Role-based Authorization Strategy pluginCode Snippet Preview:```roles {  least_privilege_deployer {    permissions: [JOB_READ, JOB_BUILD]  }  remote_access_operator {    permissions: [HOST_CONNECT]  }}``` Image: rba_configuration_snippet.png (alt text: Jenkinsfile snippet defining RBA roles)Slide 5: OpenSCAP Compliance StageDescription:• Invokes OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin against canary image• Uses FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02 profile• Archives HTML & CSV reports as build artifactsCode Snippet Preview:```openscap 'FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02'archiveArtifacts 'compliance-report.html','compliance-summary.csv'``` Slide 6: Metrics & MonitoringDescription:• Dashboard tracks compliance pass rates, approval status, P95 latencies• Prometheus & Grafana integrationImage: compliance_metrics_dashboard.png (alt text: Grafana dashboard showing pass rates and P95 latency trends)Slide 7: Automated Rollback LogicDescription:• Feature flag 'retroactiveScan' toggles rollback stage• Triggers rollback on scan failure or high-severity findingsFlow:1.

IntroductionThis planning document elaborates on the outcomes of the Chaos Schema & Metrics Deep Dive held on August 10, 2025. The purpose is to provide a structured approach for implementing the updated OpenAPI definitions for the chaos engineering schema and to formalize the resilience4j state transition metrics capture strategy. It details the rationale behind key schema modifications, outlines metric instrumentation guidelines, and presents a timeline for the next development and validation phases.2. Extended Schema Definitions2.1. OverviewDuring the deep dive, the team agreed to augment the existing chaos-schema.yaml with the following enhancements: explicit inclusion of the experimentContext object to capture test metadata, support for multi-target injection using the targets array, and enriched errorResponse section to standardize fault codes across SDKs.2.2. experimentContext ObjectWe introduce the experimentContext block with fields environment string, initiatedBy string, startTimestamp string ISO 8601, and tags array of string. This structure enables tracking of the execution environment and operator attribution. Example YAML snippet:experimentContext:  environment: staging  initiatedBy: oziller  startTimestamp: 2025-08-10T10:00:00Z  tags:    - smoke-test    - v1.2.02.3. targets ArrayThe new targets array allows specifying multiple resourceIds with associated injection profiles. Each target entry includes resourceType enum, resourceId string, and faultProfile object. This change ensures future support for parallel fault injection across heterogeneous components.3. Resilience Metrics Capture Strategy3.1. State Transition LabelsWe formalize the closed, open, half_open labels on the resilience4j_state_transitions_total counter metric. The metrics team will implement a summary vector in Micrometer with label state and expose Prometheus name resilience4j_state_transitions_total with help text. A PromQL alert rule will trigger when rate > 10 per 5m window as agreed.3.2. Histogram Bucket ConfigurationAudit-log ingestion and streaming pipelines will leverage a uniform bucket set at boundaries [50,100,200,500,1000] ms. The SDK will record end-to-end latency using Timer metrics. A Prometheus histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, endpoint)) will power the P95 alert.4. Action Items & Timeline4.1. Action Items- Shari Jatho to update chaos-schema.yaml with experimentContext and targets by 2025-08-14.- Ossie Ziller to implement Micrometer summary vector and state label by 2025-08-16.- Era Manteca to author PromQL alert rule and dashboard panels by 2025-08-18.- Sau Alquesta to validate ARM template parameter overrides in dedicated test environment by 2025-08-20.4.2.

As our platform responds to varying load conditions, it is critical to ensure that capacity adjustments do not introduce instability. Thrash prevention is achieved by enforcing a configurable cooldown period between resize operations and by monitoring resize events to warn when thresholds are exceeded.In a dynamic resizing model, the cache adapts its capacity in response to miss-rate and CPU utilization metrics. When the miss-rate exceeds the defined threshold over the evaluation window, the cache increases its size by the up_size parameter. Similarly, when CPU usage climbs above its threshold and the hit-rate remains high, the cache decreases in size. Without proper controls, these adjustments can oscillate rapidly, leading to cache thrashing and unpredictable performance.To mitigate this risk, the cache_settings.yaml schema includes a cooldown_period property that defines the minimum interval between successive resize actions. This period is measured from the timestamp of the last applied resize event. During this interval, further resize triggers are ignored, and any attempts to adjust the cache size increment a thrash warning counter. By capturing these events in jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, we gain visibility into how often resize requests are suppressed.The CacheResizerService in the authentication microservice implements this logic. After fetching metrics from Prometheus via the metrics client, it evaluates conditions such as:    long elapsed = now - lastResizeTime;    if (missRate > config.getMissThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize + config.getUpSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else if (cpuUtil > config.getCpuThreshold() && hitRate > config.getHitThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize - config.getDownSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else {        thrashWarningsCounter.increment();    }This approach ensures that cache size adjustments occur no more frequently than configured, and that any suppressed triggers are accounted for. The updateCapacity method performs boundary checks against minCapacity and maxCapacity before applying changes.On the monitoring side, we introduce a Prometheus recording rule that accumulates jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, and a Grafana panel that overlays the warning counter with jwt_cache_current_size. This correlation allows engineers to quickly identify periods where the cache reached its cooldown limit. An alert can be configured to fire when thrash warnings increment multiple times within a short timeframe, indicating that operational thresholds may need tuning.Finally, we integrate thrash regression tests into our CI pipeline. The test suite simulates continuous miss-rate spikes and verifies that no more than one resize event occurs per cooldown period. This is achieved by injecting mock metrics and advancing the internal clock within the CacheResizerService. Any deviation from expected behavior fails the build, providing immediate feedback.In production, runbook procedures include instructions to inspect the thrash warning metrics and to adjust cooldown settings if necessary. By combining configuration controls, robust implementation, and comprehensive monitoring, we ensure that dynamic resizing enhances cache efficiency without sacrificing system stability.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-29T08:30:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"78806cf8-ccee-4a19-8adb-30fef0ba8423","ChatType":"Group","ChatName":"jwt-cache-optimization-metrics","Members":["lod_shakiag","lod_rufinag","lod_emorys","lod_eramanteca","lod_markitas"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"1540f7e5-9851-4fe7-b770-7d2188cff19f","From":"lod_shakiag","ContentType":"text","Content":"Team, following up on our metrics instrumentation for jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total.

The adoption of Netty’s PooledByteBufAllocator has reduced garbage collection overhead by minimizing buffer churn, resulting in a 21.5% drop in 95th percentile latency under a 200-thread load. This analysis explores the allocation strategies that underpin this optimization, including direct versus heap buffer decisions, arena sizing, and thread-local caching. We also examine the refactored service discovery client in customer-service, where DNS lookups are cached for 60 seconds and metadata refresh logic has been extracted into a shared utility class. The combined effect of these changes has stabilized heap usage at 180 MB from a previous baseline of 210 MB, as evidenced by performance metrics captured with our JMeter test suite.In addition to memory pooling, the document delves into the enhancements to our consumer-driven contract testing workflow. We outline the process of adding a new fixture for the /transactions/status response to cover the settlementDate field, the configuration of a dedicated \"ContractTest\" stage in Jenkins, and the parallelization of four consumer verifiers to cut test runtimes from three minutes to two. Details of the Jenkinsfile syntax, including environment variable injection and stage dependencies, are provided to facilitate adoption by other service teams. The integration with the Pact Broker, combined with local dockerized verification, ensures that backward compatibility checks are automated and consistently enforced across our microservices.Finally, we present a roadmap for propagating these best practices throughout the organization. Recommendations include extending the pooled buffer approach to payments-service and new backend APIs, establishing a central Java utilities repository to host ByteBuffer management classes, and codifying our contract test conventions in the internal Engineering Style Guide. By formalizing these patterns, we aim to empower release managers and developers to maintain high performance and reliability standards as our platform continues to evolve.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T13:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-24T09:00:00Z","FileId":"16d40b14-4a74-45b4-ac64-472b1d0f9c5f","FileLocation":"files\\Memory_and_Buffer_Pooling_DeepDive.docx","FileName":"Memory_and_Buffer_Pooling_DeepDive.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-24T09:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_kerenguisbert","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_cortezdehn","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_rufinag","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_mylesm","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/PlatformEngineering/Docs","DestinationType":"site","Content":"In modern microservices architectures, the integration of a pooled ByteBuffer allocator within gRPC pipelines can significantly reduce garbage collection pressure and improve end-to-end latency. Following our recent optimizations in transaction-service and customer-service, we adopted Netty’s PooledByteBufAllocator to manage buffer lifecycles more efficiently, moving away from one-off buffer allocations that triggered frequent GC pauses. By calibrating the allocator settings to match our service concurrency patterns and peak throughput requirements, we achieved a 21.5% reduction in the 95th percentile latency under a 200-thread JMeter load. This document explores the motivations behind buffer pooling, the step-by-step integration approach, and the benchmark results that validate its performance gains.Implementing a ByteBuffer pool is only part of the solution; robust telemetry is essential to ensure that pooling behaves as intended in production. We instrumented Micrometer metrics to expose allocator statistics, including active allocations, pool misses, and thread-local cache hits. These metrics are scraped by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana dashboards, where dynamic environment variables allow us to compare 'warm' and 'cold' cache scenarios. We defined critical alerts on direct versus heap allocation ratios and on pool exhaustion thresholds to detect any regressions. The real-time insights provided by this telemetry guided further tuning of pool capacities and cache sizes, preventing allocation spikes during our high-concurrency benchmarks.To close the loop on continuous performance quality, we extended our CI pipeline with a dedicated “BufferPoolingTest” stage in Jenkins. This stage spins up a local gRPC stub and executes targeted JMeter plans that simulate end-to-end service calls under both warm and cold cache conditions. Metrics from each pipeline execution are archived and compared against historical baselines to guard against unintended regressions. By integrating this stage alongside our contract verification workflow, which publishes to the Pact Broker with parallel verifiers, we ensure that buffer pooling improvements are both performance-safe and backward-compatible before changes reach main.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-24T09:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-24T12:00:00Z","FileId":"95bc3be3-5b42-41d0-a769-696dff9bdde6","FileLocation":"files\\BufferPooling_ResearchPaper.pdf","FileName":"BufferPooling_ResearchPaper.pdf","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-24T12:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_kerenguisbert","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_cortezdehn","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_rufinag","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_mylesm","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/PlatformEngineering/ResearchPapers","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Abstract:This paper investigates the impact of buffer pooling using Netty’s PooledByteBufAllocator on gRPC-based Java microservices in the LiveOak Digital platform. Drawing on the performance optimizations implemented during the Platform Engineering Performance & Contract Validation Working Session [Event f087fb04-dde9-4e58-b2a1-f4056f748c79], we present empirical results demonstrating a 21.5% reduction in P95 latency and a 14.3% decrease in heap usage under a 200-thread JMeter load. Our contributions include a detailed analysis of GC pause reduction, an adaptive pool sizing heuristic, and guidelines for integrating buffer pooling in high-throughput service pipelines.1. IntroductionModern microservices architectures demand efficient resource management to maintain low-latency service levels under heavy loads. During the July 23, 2025 working session, the Platform Engineering team integrated pooled ByteBuffer allocators and Jackson Afterburner modules across core services. This research paper expands on those implementations, formalizing the design, experimental methodology, and results for adoption by enterprise teams.2. Background and Related WorkBuffer pooling has been shown to reduce allocation churn and GC overhead in networked applications [1]. Jackson Afterburner accelerates reflection-based JSON serialization in Java, yielding up to 30% throughput improvements [2]. JMeter-based benchmarking methodologies provide repeatable performance measurements for microservice endpoints [3], while consumer-driven contract testing ensures compatibility across evolving APIs [4].3. System Design and ImplementationWe instrumented transaction-service and customer-service to use Netty’s PooledByteBufAllocator, configured with 8 arenas and thread-local caches. The Jackson ObjectMapper was extended with the AfterburnerModule. Micrometer interceptors expose allocator_active_allocations and allocator_thread_local_cache_hits_ratio metrics, scraped by Prometheus at 15-second intervals.4. Experimental SetupPerformance tests employed JMeter ThreadGroup parameters: 200 threads, 60s ramp-up, 50 loops, Constant Throughput Timer at 200 requests/sec. Warm-cache scenarios used an HTTP Cache Manager; cold-cache tests disabled IMS headers per iteration. Metrics were collected with the jmeter-exporter and visualized in Grafana panels with dynamic phase variables.5. Results and AnalysisCold-cache P95 latency for POST /transactions/create improved from 130ms to 102ms (21.5%), and warm-cache P95 from 115ms to 95ms (17.4%). Heap usage stabilized at 180MB versus 210MB baseline. GC pause P95 under cold conditions dropped from 48ms to 12ms. Thread-local cache hit ratio exceeded 98.7%. Table 1 and Figure 3 detail these findings.6. DiscussionBuffer pooling substantially reduces GC-induced latency spikes, at the expense of moderately increased resident memory footprint due to pooled arenas. We propose an adaptive pool resizing heuristic based on real-time PGA metrics, balancing latency goals and memory constraints.7. ConclusionBuffer pooling via PooledByteBufAllocator and Jackson Afterburner integration yields significant performance gains in microservices. Future work includes dynamic pool scaling and automated integration with contract validation pipelines to ensure safe deployment of pooling optimizations.References[1] Zu, Y. and Lam, M.

By combining a pooled buffer strategy with targeted Micrometer instrumentation, our intent is to capture both allocator behavior and end-to-end latency metrics in a centralized telemetry stack. The following sections describe the code changes, metric definitions, Prometheus scraping configurations, and Grafana panel design that bring buffer pooling performance into clear view for all stakeholders.Our Java interceptor module was extended to expose three new Micrometer gauges: allocator_active_allocations, allocator_thread_local_cache_hits_ratio, and allocator_pool_misses. These metrics are registered under the ‘‘grpc.buffering’’ registry namespace to maintain separation from application-level metrics. In practice, the interceptor wraps each ByteBufAllocator invocation to record allocation events and cache hits in real time. The choice of these metrics was driven by our JMeter benchmark results, which revealed that high buffer churn corresponded directly with GC pressure spikes under cold-cache scenarios.Prometheus is configured to scrape our gRPC service endpoints at 15-second intervals, filtering only ‘‘grpc.buffering’’ metrics to reduce cardinality. The job label ‘‘jmeter-client’’ was scoped to our benchmark runs, while production traffic uses the ‘‘grpc-server’’ label. Our Prometheus target expression for GC pause P95 remains histogram_quantile(0.95,sum(rate(gc_pause_seconds_bucket{service=\"transactions\"}[5m])) by (le)), but the new allocator panels use expressions such as allocator_active_allocations and allocator_thread_local_cache_hits_ratio without further aggregation, allowing us to observe raw allocator behavior across pods.In Grafana, we created a dedicated ‘‘Buffer Pooling Overview’’ dashboard with a template variable ‘‘environment’’ scoped by job label. The active allocations panel graphs allocator_active_allocations{phase=~\"$environment\"} over time, while the thread-local cache hits ratio panel uses allocator_thread_local_cache_hits_ratio{phase=~\"$environment\"} to highlight cache efficiency. Aligning with our dynamic environment strategy, the template variable filters between ‘‘prod’’ and ‘‘canary’’ phases, enabling seamless comparison of pool behavior before and after canary pipeline runs.To ensure ongoing observability, we recommend setting alert thresholds directly on allocator_pool_misses. A sustained miss rate above 2% for more than one minute should trigger an Opsgenie event to the Platform Engineering team, since a rising miss ratio can signal pool exhaustion or misconfiguration. Pairing this alert with our existing P95 latency guards provides a comprehensive view of both application-level and buffer-level performance.This document serves as a blueprint for other service teams wishing to adopt buffer pooling telemetry. By formalizing metric names, scrape intervals, and dashboard conventions, we ensure consistency across our microservices landscape. Future work includes exploring adaptive pool sizing driven by real-time allocator metrics and expanding our CI validation to include buffer pooling regression tests via JMeter scripts embedded in the BufferPoolingTest stage.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-24T11:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-23T18:00:00Z","FileId":"0cd3e718-ea72-4f51-a283-b28639145f99","FileLocation":"files\\Performance_Contract_Metrics_Detail.xlsx","FileName":"Performance_Contract_Metrics_Detail.xlsx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-23T18:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_kerenguisbert","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_cortezdehn","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_rufinag","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_mylesm","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_tonycool","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/PlatformEngineering/Spreadsheets","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Sheet: Performance MetricsColumns: Service,Cold_Cache_P95_Baseline_ms,Cold_Cache_P95_Optimized_ms,Warm_Cache_P95_Baseline_ms,Warm_Cache_P95_Optimized_ms,Heap_Baseline_MB,Heap_Optimized_MB,Improvement_Cold_%,Improvement_Warm_%Row2: transaction-service,130,102,115,95,210,180,=ROUND((B2-C2)/B2*100,1),=ROUND((D2-E2)/D2*100,1)Row3: customer-service,145,120,130,110,215,182,=ROUND((B3-C3)/B3*100,1),=ROUND((D3-E3)/D3*100,1)Row4: payments-service,110,95,100,89,205,175,=ROUND((B4-C4)/B4*100,1),=ROUND((D4-E4)/D4*100,1)Sheet: Contract TestsColumns: Consumers,Baseline_Runtime_min,Parallel_Runtime_min,Improvement_%,Fixtures_Added,Jenkins_StageRow2: 48,3.0,2.0,=ROUND((B2-C2)/B2*100,0),/transactions/status,ContractTestSheet: Action ItemsColumns: ID,Description,Owner,Due Date,StatusRow2: AI-101,Validate canary pipeline triggers in Jenkins snippet,cortezdehn,2025-07-23,CompletedRow3: AI-102,Finalize Pact Broker namespace cleanup,rufinag,2025-07-23,In ProgressRow4: AI-103,Prepare post-canary smoke tests on QA cluster,mylesm,2025-07-24,Planned","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T18:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-02T10:00:00Z","FileId":"0005277a-0648-410d-a94c-42924759fafd","FileLocation":"files\\UserProfile_Workshop_Detailed_Outcomes.pptx","FileName":"UserProfile_Workshop_Detailed_Outcomes.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-02T10:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_missbj","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_tonycool","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_jackschrott","PermissionLevel":"edit"}],"FileDestination":"Presentations/Workshops","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title & OverviewTitle: User Profile & Notification Pipelines Workshop – Detailed OutcomesPresenter: Miss Bjorkman | Date: 2025-07-02Slide 2: Agenda1.

It is intended to guide implementation in the checkout-service-deployment job and ensure consistent reproduction across teams.The Compliance Enforcement stage is positioned in the Post-Test-Gates sequence and executes only after unit tests and integration tests have passed. It begins by assigning roles via the Role-based Authorization Strategy plugin to enforce least privilege deployment and remote access controls.Role definitions for least_privilege_deployer and remote_access_operator are declared in the Jenkinsfile using the plugin’s DSL. Permissions are bound to the checkout-service-deployment job folder so that only designated principals can invoke sensitive operations.The stage invokes the OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin against the liveoak/checkout-service:${params.VERSION}-canary container image with the FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02 profile. Upon completion, HTML and CSV reports are archived as build artifacts to provide detailed control-by-control results.Once the scan completes and artifacts are archived, a manual input gate is presented for the engineering-secpkg group to approve the findings. This gate enforces AC-17 policy sign-off and serves as a human checkpoint before production rollout.In the event of scan failures or high-severity findings, the stage triggers the feature-flag rollback logic automatically and sends a templated Slack alert to the #platform-planning channel with the summary of the failure and rollback initiation metric.This stage integrates with our LaunchDarkly feature flag framework by leveraging the retroactiveScan flag, ensuring that any deviation from compliance thresholds can be remediated through automatic rollbacks without requiring additional scripting.By standardizing the Compliance Enforcement stage in a dedicated Jenkins pipeline snippet, we reduce drift between teams and maintain alignment with regulatory requirements while preserving our continuous delivery velocity.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-20T14:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-21T16:30:00Z","FileId":"3610a1f7-56aa-40de-8551-e038d5dff5d2","FileLocation":"files\\FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx","FileName":"FeatureFlagRollout_ComplianceDeepDive.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-21T16:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_saturninasoyke","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_tisaodon","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title SlideTitle: Feature-Flag Rollout & Compliance Integration Deep DiveSubtitle: LiveOak Digital - Checkout API RemediationPresenter: Shakia GencarelliDate: July 21, 2025Slide 2: Agenda- Background & Performance Challenges- Feature-Flag Architecture- Helm & Jenkins Integration- Compliance Enforcement Stage- Metrics & Monitoring- Automated Rollback Logic- Recommendations & Next StepsSlide 3: Performance Bottleneck ReviewText: Recap of the N+1 query defect investigation and flamegraph profilingImage: Embedded flamegraph diagram (Checkout_Flamegraph.png)Alt text: Flamegraph of payment validation module hotspots under peak loadSlide 4: Feature-Flag ArchitectureBullet: Two LaunchDarkly flags: checkout_sql_batch_enabled & hibernate_query_cache_enabledBullet: Code paths conditional on flag state minimize SQL deadlocks and latencyDiagram: Flowchart illustrating flag evaluation in service logicAlt text: Flowchart showing feature-flag decision branchesSlide 5: Helm Chart IntegrationCode snippet:helm upgrade checkout-service . \\\n  --set featureFlags.checkout_sql_batch_enabled=true \\\n  --set featureFlags.hibernate_query_cache_enabled=trueDiagram: values.yaml excerpt with featureFlags blockAlt text: YAML snippet highlighting feature flag keys and boolean valuesSlide 6: Jenkins Pipeline SnippetCode snippet:stage('Compliance Enforcement') {  steps {    script {      openscap 'FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02'      archiveArtifacts artifacts: '*.html,*.csv'    }  }}Diagram: Pipeline stage flowchart showing placement of Compliance EnforcementAlt text: Jenkins pipeline diagram with Compliance Enforcement between A/B tests and final promotionSlide 7: OpenSCAP Compliance StageBullet: Profile: FedRAMPRev5-AC17-SC02 for remote access controlsBullet: Role-based Authorization Strategy plugin defines scoped rolesImage: Screenshot of Jenkins OpenSCAP plugin configuration UIAlt text: Jenkins UI showing OpenSCAP plugin settings with profile and report optionsSlide 8: Metrics & MonitoringBullet: Prometheus query: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{flag=~\"checkout_sql_batch_enabled|hibernate_query_cache_enabled\"}[5m])) by (le,flag))Bullet: Grafana 'Flag Performance' panel shows latency by flag state alongside deadlock countImage: Grafana dashboard screenshotAlt text: Time series graph of P95 latency segmented by feature-flag stateSlide 9: Automated Rollback LogicBullet: retroactiveScan flag triggers rollback on scan failure or high-severity findingsDiagram: Conditional pipeline path back to legacy flags on compliance failureAlt text: Flow diagram of rollback initiation when compliance gate failsSlide 10: Approval Sign-Off MatrixTable:Role         | Approver Group       | Status      | TimestampSecurity     | engineering-secpkg   | Approved    | 2025-07-19T17:30:00ZQA           | platform-qateam      | Approved    | 2025-07-20T10:00:00ZProduct      | platform-product     | Pending     | —Alt text: Table displaying approval statuses by security, QA, and product teamsSlide 11: Recommendations & Next Steps- Merge LiquibaseAuditRuleStage into Jenkins pipeline by July 22- Execute staging dry run on July 22 for end-to-end validation- Schedule production canary launch on July 24 at 10:00 UTC- Monitor rollback metrics and refine thresholds based on live trafficSlide 12: Q&AThank you for your attention.

It expands on the two feature flags ‘‘checkout_sql_batch_enabled’’ and ‘‘hibernate_query_cache_enabled’’ defined in our LaunchDarkly workspace, elaborating on how these flags were integrated into our continuous delivery pipeline via Helm and environment-variable wrappers. By outlining the precise mechanics of flag injection and the Helm-values configuration in vars/featureFlags.groovy, we intend to share the technical patterns that enabled a seamless switch between the legacy and optimized code paths without full redeploys, preserving service stability under peak load.The integration of these flags into our Kubernetes deployments leverages our shared Jenkins library, which was updated to accept flag values at build time. The pipeline now passes ‘‘checkout_sql_batch_enabled’’ and ‘‘hibernate_query_cache_enabled’’ as environment variables in the container spec, using --set override flags in the Helm release command. This design allows us to perform a canary deployment by toggling flag values against a specific canary instance of checkout-service:v1.2.3-canary. We maintain consistent naming conventions for the flags and reference them in the deployment chart’s values.yaml to avoid drift between staging and production environments.Our A/B testing methodology executes in two phases. The first phase directs 5 percent of incoming traffic to the canary instance for three hours, during which we collect P95 latency, error-rate, and deadlock counts via Prometheus histograms and custom JProfiler metrics published through Micrometer. We established performance thresholds of P95 latency below 200 milliseconds and maximum CPU utilization under 70 percent. Grafana dashboards were configured to automatically refresh every 30 seconds, providing near‐real-time visibility into histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{flag=~\"batchEnabled|cacheEnabled\"}[1m])) by (le)). Following successful validation at 5 percent, we amplify the canary slice to 50 percent traffic and re‐evaluate for another three-hour window.To mitigate risk, we defined precise progression criteria and rollback contingencies. Should P95 latency exceed our SLA or if any SQLExceptions indicating new deadlocks appear in the application logs, the Jenkins pipeline invokes a built-in rollback stage that flips the flags back to ‘‘false’’ and automatically triggers helm rollback for the canary release. We also added a manual approval gate prior to the 100 percent enablement step, ensuring sign-off from Security, QA, and Product stakeholders via an input step that references the OpenSCAP scan report archived as build artifacts.Next steps include finalizing the Confluence page in EngineeringDocuments space with code snippets, pipeline screenshots, and a link to this detailed strategy doc. We will convene a cross-functional review on July 22 to confirm the rollout timeline and to synchronize on the production canary launch.

We focus on the updated Go service testing conventions, performance gains from container and module caching strategies, and next steps to standardize these improvements across our microservices portfolio.Go Test Hygiene Refinement: We adopted the testify/mock framework with mockery to generate consistent stubs, incorporated t.Cleanup in our table-driven subtests to reset shared state, and integrated go-junit-report into the Go test stage to produce JUnit XML artifacts for GitLab merge request annotations. Our updated docs/ci/fragments/go-tests.yml now enforces a minimum 85% coverage threshold per package and fails the job upon breaches.Parallel Stage Performance: By switching the schema-validator container to an Alpine multi-stage build, we reduced validation time by approximately 15 seconds per run. Additionally, we introduced a Go module cache layer (`go mod download` in a dedicated Docker layer and persisting $GOCACHE on the Jenkins agent) which yields a 30-second cold start improvement for Go tests. Node stage memory consumption was stabilized with `--max-old-space-size=2048`, and we are tracking optimized runtimes in the CI-CD_Pipeline_Stage_Timings.csv dashboard.Next Steps: We will formalize the module caching snippet in our global pipeline template (ci-retrofit-template.yml), roll out the Alpine schema-validator across all parallel gates, and conduct a team review of HPA memory target adjustments (85%→80%) during our next #ci-cd-sync meeting. Finally, I’ll circulate a link to this one-pager and collect feedback before embedding these changes into our CONTRIBUTING.md and Jenkins shared library.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T16:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-21T11:00:00Z","FileId":"413dd5c8-be28-4659-a1e5-956d2622aa6d","FileLocation":"files\\Checkout_Perf_Compliance_Study.pdf","FileName":"Checkout_Perf_Compliance_Study.pdf","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-21T11:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_saturninasoyke","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/ResearchPapers","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Title: A Comprehensive Study on Checkout Service Performance and Compliance IntegrationAbstractThis paper presents a systematic investigation into the cross-functional workflow employed by LiveOak Digital’s Engineering Leadership team to remediate performance bottlenecks in the customer checkout service while satisfying FedRAMP Rev 5 compliance requirements. We detail methodologies for identifying N+1 query defects [1], designing controlled A/B tests for feature-flag rollouts [2], and integrating OpenSCAP-based security scans into a declarative Jenkins pipeline [3]. Our contributions include performance profiling patterns, rollout criteria design, and compliance enforcement blueprints, accompanied by empirical results demonstrating P95 latency improvements from 350 ms to 150 ms and zero SQL deadlocks under high load.1. IntroductionHigh-throughput e-commerce platforms face critical challenges when performance regressions coincide with stringent regulatory controls. In July 2025, the LiveOak Digital platform encountered a 30 percent increase in checkout P95 latency and intermittent SQL deadlocks during peak traffic. As part of the Platform Engineering group, we embarked on a multi-step remediation that combined deep performance analysis with automated compliance validation. This study codifies our approach and lessons learned, contributing to best practices for performance-compliance co-engineering in microservices.2. Performance Profiling MethodologyWe employed dynamic instrumentation via JProfiler and Micrometer histograms [4] to capture full-stack flamegraphs of the payment validation module. Bottleneck analysis identified an N+1 query against the orders table exacerbated by Hibernate cache eviction patterns. We drafted performance test cases with target thresholds (P95 < 200 ms, CPU < 70 percent) and executed A/B comparisons under LaunchDarkly feature flags “checkout_sql_batch_enabled” and “hibernate_query_cache_enabled”. Metrics collection used Prometheus pulls at 30s intervals, aligning with Grafana dashboards for real-time visibility [5].3. Feature Flag Rollout DesignOur rollout strategy defined two phases: a 5 percent traffic slice for 3 hours and a subsequent 50 percent slice pending SLA validation. We automated flag injection via Helm values in the Kubernetes deployment and validated end-to-end latency, error rates, and deadlock counts at each checkpoint. Empirical data showed a P95 drop from 350 ms to 160 ms in the canary slice, enabling safe progression criteria.4. Compliance Enforcement IntegrationTo satisfy FedRAMP Rev 5 controls AC-17 (Remote Access) and SC-02 (Least Privilege), we integrated an OpenSCAP Jenkins plugin stage in the Post-Test-Gates of our pipeline [3]. We defined Role-Based Authorization Strategy roles (least_privilege_deployer, remote_access_operator) to scope permissions, invoked OpenSCAP scans against container images for TLS 1.2+ FIPS-validated cipher suites, and paused for manual security/QE sign-off via an input gate. Fail-fast rollback logic was implemented to trigger feature-flag reversion upon scan failures.5. Results and DiscussionCombined performance tuning and compliance automation yielded P95 latency of 150 ms, CPU max of 60 percent, and zero deadlocks over multi-hour test windows. The integrated pipeline ensured security controls did not impair performance delivery. Key insights include the importance of systematic histograms for real-time decision making [4], and the utility of feature flags as rollback-safe delivery mechanisms [2].6. ConclusionOur case study demonstrates that cohesive engineering processes can reconcile high-performance requirements with stringent compliance mandates. By coupling precise profiling, controlled feature-flag rollouts, and automated security gating, teams can achieve both performance and security objectives without bottlenecking delivery velocity.References[1] A.

IntroductionThis document outlines the plan for extending and integrating the comprehensive unit test suites developed during the Onboarding Microservice Unit Tests Deep Dive Session on July 22-23, 2025. It provides strategic context for stakeholders in the Platform and Solutions Architecture teams to ensure that our customer-onboarding microservice achieves maintainable, high-confidence code coverage and robust CI/CD pipeline integration.2. Workshop RecapOn July 22, 2025, the core team led by Saturnina Soyke convened a three-hour hands-on workshop with participation from Jason Adon, Tisa Odonoghue, Shari Jatho, and Ashley Engel. The group reviewed API schema definitions with Tony Coolbrith and Marisol Chen, explored Dependency Injection patterns in router-module and data-access components, and finalized compliance traceability requirements for the RSD spec. A pair-programming session followed to author JUnit 5 test classes TransactionServiceTest and UserProfileControllerTest, leveraging Mockito mocks and parameterized tests driven by onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml in test-fixtures/onboarding-mocks.jar.3. Goals and Objectives- Ensure at least 92% line coverage for TransactionServiceTest and 90% for UserProfileControllerTest across all branches.- Integrate the new test suites into the Jenkins customer-onboarding-pipeline with parallel matrix execution and failFast:false configuration.- Standardize naming conventions and MethodSource mappings in test fixtures to support continuous traceability under RSD compliance guidelines.- Automate test report aggregation and gating logic within the UnitTests stage, with COVERAGE_THRESHOLD overrides for develop (85%) and main (90%) environments.4. Detailed RoadmapPhase 1: Stabilization (July 24–July 28, 2025)- Finalize exception handlers in UserProfileControllerAdvice to cover DateTimeParseException and IllegalArgumentException.- Update onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml with additional boundary cases (timestampLeapSecond, missingPayload) and host under test-resources/onboarding.- Author and peer-review PRs for exception handler updates and test scenario expansion, targeting feature/onsite-unit-tests branch.Phase 2: CI/CD Integration (July 29–August 2, 2025)- Modify ci/jenkins/customer-onboarding-pipeline.groovy to include a parallel matrix for both test suites with failFast:false flags.- Implement JUnit XML aggregation step and code coverage report publication in the UnitTests stage, uploading coverage metrics and test reports.- Parameterize COVERAGE_THRESHOLD per module, defaulting to 85% for develop and 90% for main using Jenkins parameters and env.BRANCH_NAME logic.- Conduct validation builds, capture test execution metrics, and review performance improvements (reduced CI stage time from ~15m to ~6m45s).Phase 3: Compliance and Reporting (August 3–August 9, 2025)- Extend Jenkins pipeline to emit RSD compliance traceability artifacts (complianceID, traceabilityReportDir) via shared library rsdComplianceCheck under specs/2025-07-22/pipelines.- Integrate report generation with the CI dashboard, merging JUnit, coverage, and RSD artifacts into a unified pipeline summary.- Schedule cross-functional review with Solutions Architecture and UX teams to validate final reports and ensure alignment with product requirements.5. Resource AssignmentsSaturnina Soyke – Project Sponsor: Oversee traceability requirements and final sign-off; review pipeline changes by August 4.Jason Adon – Test Framework Lead: Author exception handler PR and Mockito best-practice guidelines; complete by July 27.Tisa Odonoghue – CI/CD Engineer: Implement Jenkinsfile updates, matrix parallelization, and coverage thresholds; complete initial validation by July 31.Shari Jatho – Compliance Architect: Verify RSD artifacts, naming conventions, and merge guidelines; finalize report templates by August 5.Ashley Engel – QA Analyst: Execute test scenarios in staging, document anomalies in coverage_metrics_report.json, and report findings by August 7.6. Risks and MitigationsRisk: DateTimeParseException not handled may cause unexpected test failures and pipeline aborts.Mitigation: Extend global exception handler in UserProfileControllerAdvice and validate via negative scenario tests in onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml.Risk: Jenkins pipeline matrix misconfiguration leading to missing test suite execution.Mitigation: Include failFast:false, implement JUnit XML aggregation, and perform smoke tests post-integration to verify both TransactionServiceTest and UserProfileControllerTest run.Risk: Coverage thresholds too rigid prevent merges on develop branch.Mitigation: Parameterize thresholds per branch with env.BRANCH_NAME logic in coverage.groovy, defaulting to 85% on develop to allow incremental improvements.7.

Our goal is to ensure that users receive consistent and informative error responses while maintaining full traceability of failures for compliance and diagnostic purposes. The patterns described in this guide build on the work conducted during the recent Onboarding Unit Tests Deep Dive Session and incorporate boundary case considerations for timestamp parsing and null payload scenarios.The first section reviews the default behavior of Spring’s @ExceptionHandler annotation and the importance of centralizing exception mapping logic. We demonstrate how to extend the existing handler in UserProfileControllerAdvice to catch both IllegalArgumentException and DateTimeParseException. By consolidating these exceptions into a unified bad request response, we reduce code duplication across controllers and improve the user experience for clients consuming our REST API. The guide provides code snippets showing the updated handler signature and explains the rationale for including multiple exception types within a single annotation array.Next, we address the critical boundary scenarios that emerged from the onboardingErrorScenarios.yaml file. The missingTimestamp case highlights the need to detect null or empty timestamp strings early in the request processing pipeline and to return a clear ‘MISSING_TIMESTAMP’ error code. For the timestampLeapSecond scenario, we walk through parsing logic that leverages Java’s DateTimeFormatter with ResolverStyle.STRICT to correctly validate leap second inputs, accompanied by a fallback mapping to an ‘INVALID_TIMESTAMP’ error response. These examples illustrate how to integrate custom validation into the controller advice and ensure consistency with our JUnit parameterized tests.Finally, the guide outlines best practices for enriching error responses with traceability metadata. We recommend including a unique correlation ID and the original exception message in the ErrorResponse payload, as well as logging the full stack trace and request context at the INFO level. By configuring our Jenkins pipeline to aggregate test results and coverage metrics under the UnitTests stage, we can automatically verify that all exception scenarios are covered by our TransactionServiceTest and UserProfileControllerTest suites. This end-to-end approach ensures that any future modifications to exception handling logic are captured by automated tests and gating policies before merging into staging.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-24T10:00:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"456 Redwood Avenue"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering Leadership","DisplayName":"Saturnina Soyke","FirstName":"Saturnina","JobTitle":"Director of Platform Engineering","LastName":"Soyke","MailNickName":"lod_saturninasoyke","Manager":null,"OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 4321","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"742 Redwood Crossing"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Solutions Architecture","DisplayName":"Jason Adon","FirstName":"Jason","JobTitle":"Solutions Architect","LastName":"Adon","MailNickName":"lod_jasonadon","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3172","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Sierra Pine Rd"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Tisa Odonoghue","FirstName":"Tisa","JobTitle":"DevOps Engineer","LastName":"Odonoghue","MailNickName":"lod_tisaodon","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3287","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"158 Willow Creek Drive"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Solutions Architecture","DisplayName":"Shari Jatho","FirstName":"Shari","JobTitle":"Solutions Architect","LastName":"Jatho","MailNickName":"lod_sharij","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2837","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"654 Maple Drive"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Ashley Engel","FirstName":"Ashley","JobTitle":"QA Engineer","LastName":"Engel","MailNickName":"lod_ashleyengel","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2987","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

The adoption of Netty’s PooledByteBufAllocator has reduced garbage collection overhead by minimizing buffer churn, resulting in a 21.5% drop in 95th percentile latency under a 200-thread load. This analysis explores the allocation strategies that underpin this optimization, including direct versus heap buffer decisions, arena sizing, and thread-local caching. We also examine the refactored service discovery client in customer-service, where DNS lookups are cached for 60 seconds and metadata refresh logic has been extracted into a shared utility class. The combined effect of these changes has stabilized heap usage at 180 MB from a previous baseline of 210 MB, as evidenced by performance metrics captured with our JMeter test suite.In addition to memory pooling, the document delves into the enhancements to our consumer-driven contract testing workflow. We outline the process of adding a new fixture for the /transactions/status response to cover the settlementDate field, the configuration of a dedicated \"ContractTest\" stage in Jenkins, and the parallelization of four consumer verifiers to cut test runtimes from three minutes to two. Details of the Jenkinsfile syntax, including environment variable injection and stage dependencies, are provided to facilitate adoption by other service teams. The integration with the Pact Broker, combined with local dockerized verification, ensures that backward compatibility checks are automated and consistently enforced across our microservices.Finally, we present a roadmap for propagating these best practices throughout the organization. Recommendations include extending the pooled buffer approach to payments-service and new backend APIs, establishing a central Java utilities repository to host ByteBuffer management classes, and codifying our contract test conventions in the internal Engineering Style Guide. By formalizing these patterns, we aim to empower release managers and developers to maintain high performance and reliability standards as our platform continues to evolve.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T13:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-02T10:00:00Z","FileId":"0005277a-0648-410d-a94c-42924759fafd","FileLocation":"files\\UserProfile_Workshop_Detailed_Outcomes.pptx","FileName":"UserProfile_Workshop_Detailed_Outcomes.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-02T10:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_missbj","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_tonycool","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_jackschrott","PermissionLevel":"edit"}],"FileDestination":"Presentations/Workshops","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title & OverviewTitle: User Profile & Notification Pipelines Workshop – Detailed OutcomesPresenter: Miss Bjorkman | Date: 2025-07-02Slide 2: Agenda1.

The HMAC validation approach is designed to ensure message integrity and protect our Kafka ingestion pipeline from payload tampering. The pseudocode presented highlights the retrieval of the secret key from Vault using the shared library function validateConfigFiles(), the computation of the HmacSHA256 signature, and the constant-time comparison strategy to mitigate timing attack vectors. Detailed code snippets are included to illustrate the integration points within the Java service and the Jenkins hmacValidationTest stage.The secret management strategy leverages Vault’s KV v2 engine with dynamic TTL extension and backoff jitter. The validateConfigFiles() function orchestrates secret retrieval and renewal, anchored by the exponential backoff factor and jitter margin parameters defined in our design document. The document explains the configuration of the Vault-backed OAuth2 service, the 24-hour key rotation schedule, and the integration of the rotation logic into the JwtCacheLRU decorator to enforce eviction of stale credentials before reuse. A section is devoted to the pseudocode for the LRU decorator, showcasing how effectiveTTL is computed and applied within the cache entry refresh cycle.Integration into the CI pipeline is achieved through the Jenkinsfile.security.groovy stage named hmacValidationTest. The document describes how the pipeline fetches the HMAC Vault credentials via Jenkins credentials binding, executes validation tests against representative payload samples, and publishes results to Confluence via REST API. The configuration of JUnit XML reporting and archiving of artifacts is detailed, including the naming conventions and the reports directory structure. Insights into failure thresholds and automated notifications in the #devops-alerts channel are provided to ensure rapid response to test regressions.Performance considerations are addressed with reference to the JMH microbenchmark results captured on June 19. The document presents the P95 and P99 latency measurements under concurrent session loads, illustrating drift percentages under 5% for 3 000 sessions. A comparison of jitter parameters for linux_arm and windows_x64 agents is included, along with recommendations for adjusting default TTL to 4 800 seconds (80 minutes) to accommodate high-QPS login flows. The impact of backoff factor tuning and jitter margin variations on message processing latency is analyzed, supported by charts and metrics drawn from our detailed workbook.Next steps and action items conclude the document. The team is advised to finalize the unit tests for boundary scenarios, validate the constant-time comparison logic with fuzz testing, and parameterize the HMAC key rotation interval in the shared library refactor. A roadmap for the staging rollout is provided, including alignment with the smoke test schedule on June 28 and coordination with QA for end-to-end verification of the HMAC validation layer in the feature/fraud-security-integration branch.","TimeStamp":"2025-06-21T14:45:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"ff265d71-2373-4288-9162-beb2b1c19d39","ChatType":"Group","ChatName":"FraudSecurity-HMAC-Review","Members":["lod_markitas","lod_terinahafen","lod_kerenguisbert","lod_octaviaj"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"f605356c-e1dc-47ae-b12a-04549991c5e3","From":"lod_markitas","ContentType":"text","Content":"Hi team, I\u0019m implementing the HMAC validation layer per our design doc.

A rapid response uncovered two primary contributors: an HPA resource request misconfiguration capping pods at three and an overly aggressive exponential backoff algorithm in //libs/transaction/retry.go without proper jitter. This one-pager dives into the technical changes that restored stable throughput at 300 QPS with p95 latency under 120 ms.HPA Configuration TuningWe adjusted the Kubernetes HPA CPU request from 100 m to 200 m and lowered the target utilization threshold from 70% to 55%. Scaling tests showed that under a 300 QPS traffic pattern, the pods now scale from three to five replicas in approximately 50 seconds, matching scale-up targets. A 180-second downscale stabilization window prevents thrash during oscillating loads. Terraform PR #216 includes the updated module parameters and a new runbook section documenting the deployment steps and rollback procedures.Retry Backoff ImprovementsThe retry library has been refactored to use a base delay of 50 ms, capped at 150 ms, and supplemented with uniform jitter in the range of 0–100 ms. This change smooths out retry bursts when downstream Kafka brokers return HTTP 429, eliminating execution stalls. Unit and benchmark tests now cover rapid 429 sequences, confirming a 20% reduction in tail delay. Prometheus histogram buckets have been updated to surface sub-50 ms latency distributions and a new 150 ms bucket for rapid diagnostics.Combined Resiliency OutcomesBy synchronizing HPA tuning with refined backoff logic, we achieved stable pod counts, consistent p95 latencies below 120 ms, and zero connection exhaustion events in production. Next steps include integrating these metrics into our Grafana dashboards, automating alert thresholds for both CPU utilization and retry delay distributions, and conducting canary validations in staging.

At 300 QPS, pod usage hit 320m in p95, so HPA scaled from 3 to 5 replicas in around 50s, matching our scale-up expectations. However, scale-down didn't kick in until avg CPU dropped below 40% (80m) sustained for 5m, causing a 6m over-provision. To optimize, I propose lowering target avg utilization to 55%, increasing downscale stabilization to 180s, and introducing an external metric based on p95 service latency (115ms) for more precise scaling.

This one-pager provides a technical breakdown of the scaling adjustments and retry logic enhancements that resolved the incident and the next steps for long-term resilience.HPA Configuration Tuning: We increased the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler CPU request from 100m to 200m and lowered the target utilization threshold from 70 percent to 55 percent. A 180 second downscale stabilization window was added to prevent thrashing during transient load dips. In our HPA and Backoff Test Results for iteration seven, these changes reduced scale up time to 40 seconds at 300 QPS and scale down time to 150 seconds, with p95 latency under 120 milliseconds and error rate below 0.5 percent.Retry Backoff Improvements: The retry library in libs/transaction/retry.go was refactored to implement a base delay of 50 milliseconds, cap at 150 milliseconds, and uniform jitter up to 100 milliseconds. Table driven unit tests now simulate rapid 429 sequences to validate delay distributions. Early sandbox benchmarks show a twenty percent reduction in tail latency and elimination of connection pool exhaustion errors in Envoy sidecars.Next Steps: Complete merge of PR number 216 for HPA module tuning and PR number 215 for jitter patch by July 21. Integrate updated histogram buckets and alert thresholds p95 greater than 150 milliseconds and p99 greater than 200 milliseconds into Grafana dashboards.

Promtail Relabeling Configuration[Image 2: Promtail Relabel Flowchart]Code Snippet:```yamlscrape_configs:  - job_name: payments-transactor    static_configs:      - targets: ['localhost:9080']    relabel_configs:      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]        action: keep      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]        action: keep      - action: labelmap        regex: __meta_kubernetes_(.+)      - action: replace        target_label: job        replacement: payments-transactor```3. Grafana Alert Rule Flow[Image 3: Alert Evaluation Flowchart]We leverage histogram_quantile over a 5m window:```yamlgroups:- name: PaymentsTransactorAlerts  rules:  - alert: HighP99Latency    expr: histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, pod_name)) > 0.2    for: 5m    labels:      severity: page    annotations:      summary: \"p99 latency above 200ms for >5m\"```4. HPA External Metrics Setup[Image 4: HPA External Metrics Diagram]We extended the Kubernetes HPA to use both CPU and p95 latency:```yamlmetrics:  - type: Resource    resource:      name: cpu      target:        type: Utilization        averageUtilization: 55  - type: External    external:      metric:        name: custom_p95_latency      target:        type: Value        value: \"120ms\"``` 5. Best Practices & Troubleshooting- Always preserve kubernetes_pod_name label in Promtail relabel stage.- Verify new histogram buckets with Promtail logs: no parse errors.- Test alert rules in staging using `grafana_play` script before prod rollout.- Use canary deployments and monitor both CPU and latency metrics concurrently.Appendix: Full relabel_config, alert JSON panel, and sample HPA spec are included at the end of this guide for copy-paste convenience.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-18T17:55:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-19T09:00:00Z","FileId":"a5b262fb-1abc-4cc1-be28-5b4c06a2acbd","FileLocation":"files\\Payments-Transactor_Deep_Dive.pptx","FileName":"Payments-Transactor_Deep_Dive.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-19T09:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_oziller","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_shawnnas","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_rufinag","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_mylesm","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared

This paper investigates the design, implementation, and evaluation of an adaptive LRU cache resizing mechanism based on miss-rate thresholds and real-time telemetry in a high-throughput Kafka consumer service.1. IntroductionModern stream processing systems often rely on in-memory caches to accelerate authentication and message routing. Static cache configurations fail to accommodate sudden surges in request volume, leading to increased eviction cycles and latency spikes (Smith et al., 2019). Our engineering team at LiveOak Digital observed intermittent kafka_consumer_group_lag spikes under sustained 5k msg/sec loads and developed a dynamic resizing proposal to address these issues.2. Background and Related WorkDynamic cache management has been explored in web applications (Doe and Roe, 2020) and database systems (Johnson and Lee, 2018). However, its application within real-time Kafka consumer contexts remains under-studied. Prior studies (Miller et al., 2021) demonstrate the benefits of miss-rate-driven policies, but lack integration with CI telemetry pipelines.3. System Model and RequirementsWe define the cache state C(n) with capacity n, and measure miss rate m over a sliding window w. The resizing controller triggers an increase delta when m > μ for a duration τ (LiveOak Digital, 2025). Requirements include avoiding oscillations, bounding maximum capacity, and ensuring sub-3ms p95 latency for jwt_validation.4. Implementation Details4.1 ArchitectureThe cache component integrates with Micrometer for metric emission. Recording rules tag p95 latency by phase and environment (unit-test, smoke-test, canary). The controller runs in a dedicated scheduler thread and applies size adjustments via JMX hooks.4.2 Configurationdynamic_cache_settings.yaml defines parameters: maxCap, maxGrow, stabilityWindow, cooldownMs, and missThreshold. Example:  cacheSettings:    maxCap: 512    maxGrow: 75    stabilityWindow: 3m    cooldownMs: 600000    missThreshold: 0.014.3 Spring Boot IntegrationProperties bind to @ConfigurationProperties(prefix='auth.cache'), enabling external overrides in staging and production profiles.5. Experimental Evaluation5.1 Test SetupWe deployed a Minikube cluster with mockAuthService stub and JMeter-driven 8k msg/sec load. Metrics collected over 30-minute canary runs.5.2 ResultsTable 1 shows eviction events, cache sizes, and latencies. Dynamic resizing engaged twice, maintaining p95 <3ms. Comparative tests with static caches of 256 and 512 entries exhibited 25% higher latency and 40% more eviction cycles.6. DiscussionDynamic resizing reduces manual tuning and adapts to workload fluctuations. Proper cooldown durations prevent thrashing. Integration with CI telemetry ensures early detection of regressions (García et al., 2022).7. Conclusion and Future WorkOur adaptive cache controller significantly improves end-to-end streaming reliability. Future research will explore predictive resize models using time-series forecasting and extend the approach to multi-tenant consumer groups.References[1] Smith, A., Kumar, P.

By integrating real-time telemetry and a threshold-driven controller, we ensure that cache capacity adapts automatically to workload fluctuations, maintaining sub-3 ms p95 jwt_validation_latency and preventing backpressure in the streaming pipeline.Design and Implementation:At service startup, the LRU cache preloads active public keys, eliminating synchronous disk I/O on misses. The resize controller monitors the miss-rate metric (jwt_cache_miss_rate) over a sliding window (stabilityWindow) and triggers capacity increases of maxGrow entries when the miss rate exceeds missThreshold. Each resize action is subject to a cooldown (cooldownMs) to prevent oscillations. Metrics are emitted via Micrometer and collected by Prometheus, with recording rules tagged by phase (unit-test, smoke-test, canary) and environment (staging).Configuration Parameters:The dynamic_cache_settings.yaml file defines key parameters: maxCap: 512 (upper bound), maxGrow: 75 (entries per resize), stabilityWindow: 3m (miss-rate evaluation window), cooldownMs: 600000 (10-minute interval between resizes), and missThreshold: 0.01 (1% miss rate trigger). These defaults have been validated in staging canary runs at 8k msg/sec, showing two resize events with stable latencies and zero OOM events.Next Steps:We recommend integrating the dynamic resizing health check into the incident runbook and adding a Prometheus alert (CacheResizeMissThresholdBreached) to flag sustained miss-rate breaches. Additionally, updating the CI pipeline templates to parameterize missThreshold values will enable us to test boundary scenarios automatically. Production rollout is scheduled for 2025-07-30, with final verification via Grafana dashboards featuring interactive phase and environment filters.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-26T09:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-28T09:00:00Z","FileId":"c512162f-9ea3-4363-8947-6450a9bdf71d","FileLocation":"files\\Detailed_Cache_Resize_Parameter_Sensitivity.xlsx","FileName":"Detailed_Cache_Resize_Parameter_Sensitivity.xlsx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-28T09:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_octaviaj","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Reports/Analyses","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Sheet: RawMetricsTimestamp,MsgRate,MissRate,CacheSize,Evictions,P95LatencyMs2025-07-24T08:05:00Z,8000,0.012,325,2,2.72025-07-24T08:10:00Z,8000,0.009,325,0,2.42025-07-24T08:15:00Z,8000,0.015,400,3,3.02025-07-24T08:20:00Z,8000,0.008,400,0,2.12025-07-24T08:25:00Z,8000,0.013,475,2,3.22025-07-24T08:30:00Z,8000,0.010,475,0,2.52025-07-24T08:35:00Z,8000,0.016,550,3,3.12025-07-24T08:40:00Z,8000,0.007,550,0,1.92025-07-24T08:45:00Z,8000,0.014,625,3,3.32025-07-24T08:50:00Z,8000,0.011,625,0,2.62025-07-24T08:55:00Z,8000,0.009,625,2,2.8Sheet: ResizeActionsActionID,Timestamp,TriggerCondition,PrevCacheSize,NewCacheSize,CooldownRemainingMs1,2025-07-24T08:15:30Z,MissRate>0.01,325,400,6000002,2025-07-24T08:25:45Z,MissRate>0.012,400,475,5400003,2025-07-24T08:35:20Z,MissRate>0.014,475,550,4800004,2025-07-24T08:45:10Z,MissRate>0.015,550,625,420000Sheet: SensitivityAnalysisParameter,TestValue,AvgEvictions,AvgLatency,AvgMissRateDefault,MaxCap=512;MaxGrow=75;StabilityWindow=3m;Threshold=0.01,2.0,2.9,0.011maxGrow=50,50,2.5,3.1,0.013maxGrow=100,100,1.8,2.5,0.010missThreshold=0.012,0.012,2.1,2.7,0.012stabilityWindow=4m,4m,1.9,2.8,0.012stabilityWindow=2m,2m,2.4,3.3,0.014Sheet: SummaryMetricsMetric,Formula,ValueTotalEvictions,=SUM(RawMetrics!E2:E12),15AvgMissRate,=AVERAGE(RawMetrics!C2:C12),0.011MaxP95Latency,=MAX(RawMetrics!F2:F12),3.3TotalResizes,=COUNTA(ResizeActions!A2:A5),4BaselineLatency,=INDEX(SensitivityAnalysis!D:D,MATCH(\"Default\",SensitivityAnalysis!A:A,0)),2.9Impact_MaxGrow100,=INDEX(SensitivityAnalysis!D:D,MATCH(\"maxGrow=100\",SensitivityAnalysis!A:A,0))-BaselineLatency,-0.4","TimeStamp":"2025-07-28T09:00:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"5ff2b3cf-0fb8-4821-9c0a-bc88b884ec6b","ChatType":"Meeting","EventId":"59c7b052-9fe0-4053-8fc5-a3cc4714d5c7","Members":["lod_shakiag","lod_oziller","lod_sharij","lod_eramanteca","lod_saulq"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"cc955d23-0f6c-42e5-ae4f-668f1ce47444","From":"lod_oziller","ContentType":"text","Content":"Thanks everyone for the insightful breakdown of Resilience4j metrics.

IntroductionThis workshop is designed to build upon the foundational configuration standards work performed on 2025-07-23 and refined through subsequent deep dives. We will explore the integration of secure default values, Vault secret reference patterns, advanced JSON Schema features, and automated validation pipelines. Participants will gain hands-on experience with crafting schema rules, patternProperties, and integrating AJV into Jenkins for real-time feedback.2. Workshop ObjectivesThe primary objectives of the session are to: • Solidify safe defaults enforcement by extending the telemetry-config schema to include default values for key properties. • Demonstrate how to author and test patternProperties for vaultReference URIs to prevent misconfiguration. • Walk through the Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy pipeline snippet, focusing on parallel fixture tests, verbose error reporting, and Slack notification integration. • Provide guided exercises that replicate real-world scenarios, including pushing sample YML snippets with both valid and invalid vault URIs. • Establish a clear post-workshop action plan, assigning ownership for rolling out changes across additional repositories and service teams.3. Agenda OverviewThe workshop will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM PST on 2025-07-27 in Teams Meeting format. High-level agenda: • 2:00 – 2:15 PM: Opening remarks and recapitulation of prior sessions. • 2:15 – 3:00 PM: Secure Defaults deep dive: Vault KV patterns and kebab-case conventions. • 3:00 – 3:45 PM: JSON Schema patternProperties: advanced use cases and edge conditions. • 3:45 – 4:00 PM: Break. • 4:00 – 4:45 PM: Hands-on lab: AJV validate and test commands in CI pipeline with fixtures. • 4:45 – 5:00 PM: Wrap-up, Q&A, and assignment of follow-up tasks.4. Detailed Session Breakdown4.1 Secure Defaults & Vault Reference PatternsWe will begin by revisiting the Vault secret reference patterns introduced in PR #127 and #130, examining the regex ^vault://secret/data/[\\\\w/]+#[\\\\w-]+$ and its placement under the vaultReference node. Attendees will modify example auth-config snippets to practice enforcing version:2 defaults and validate them against the schema using ajv validate --strict. We will discuss the implications of object merging in patternProperties and how to scope regex tests to specific nodes, ensuring that unintentional mutations do not compromise security agreements.4.2 JSON Schema Enhancements & PatternPropertiesThis section delves into the modifications in configs/schema/telemetry-config-schema.json. We will walk through the insertion of default: 1048576 for maxReceiveMessageSize and the addition of a patternProperties block. Using the Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy parallel stage, participants will observe how invalid URIs are flagged and how fixture tests under configs/schema/fixtures provide coverage for both positive and negative cases. We will analyze sample fixture error logs to identify full data paths in verbose AJV output and refine the schema accordingly, strengthening maintainability and reducing ambiguous validation failures.4.3 AJV Pipeline Integration & Fixture TestsBuilding on section 4.2, the focus shifts to integrating AJV into a CI/CD pipeline. We will examine the complete pipeline DSL and execute a live run of the schema validation stage, demonstrating the --errors-distinct and --verbose flags. Attendees will create a minimal Jenkinsfile snippet, commit to a feature branch, and observe real-time notifications in #devops-alerts. Emphasis will be placed on reducing validation time through parallel stages, optimizing test fixture design, and leveraging Slack notifications for immediate feedback.5. Pre-Workshop Preparation and Required ArtifactsParticipants should complete the following prerequisites before the workshop begins: • Clone the telemetry-config and ci-config repositories and switch to the schema-validation branch. • Review the Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx (FileId: 9d6fb2b4-be42-4061-8b5f-3df08c2b6766) and Config_Change_Log.xlsx (FileId: 106554d5-ad9b-4972-863e-ad73a5fbd6fd). • Ensure a working Jenkins environment with the AJV CLI installed and Slack integration configured. • Validate access to configs/schema/fixtures for the JSON test suite, including valid-vaultReference.json and invalid-vaultReference.json.6. Post-Workshop Deliverables and Follow-Up ActionsAfter the session, attendees are expected to: • Merge approved schema patches into the main branch and bump the telemetry-config version. • Update the Confluence “Configuration File Best Practices” page with code examples and CI pipeline snippets. • Assign follow-up tasks in Jira: AI-132 for patternProperties review, AI-133 for Vault integration enhancements, and AI-134 for cross-service rollout. • Monitor the #devops-alerts channel for validation results and CI feedback on additional repositories.Appendix A: Reference Materials • Secure Defaults and Vault Integration Guide: https://liveoak.sharepoint.com/sites/devops/Shared%20Documents/DevOps/Guides/Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx • Schema Validation Pipeline DSL: Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy (FileId: 568a72db-7e31-46f8-957d-b41ccb9caa4e) • Infographic: Indentation_Impact.png (FileId: 6a0afa1b-4910-4672-ad27-43740439d35b) • Deep Dive Slides: Config_Schema_DeepDive_Slides.pptx (FileId: 09990c7a-8ef8-48e1-9c53-dc6a215b0784)","TimeStamp":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"7684d4d3-01e0-48d8-b3a8-06a9ee1ae1d7","ChatType":"Group","ChatName":"Schema-Validation-Discussion","Members":["lod_jasonadon","lod_tisaodon","lod_eramanteca"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"866bc034-afa2-4d3f-aeee-b3ef6a50d2bb","From":"lod_jasonadon","ContentType":"text","Content":"Tisa, I’ve added \"default\":1048576 under maxReceiveMessageSize in telemetry-config-schema.json.

This document provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the enhanced AJV-based schema validation stage recently added to our Jenkins CI, designed to catch configuration errors at commit time and surface them immediately in our Slack alerts channel. Building on the initial implementation in Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage.groovy, we now execute two parallel sub-stages: one dedicated to rapid YAML linting against configs/schema/telemetry-config-schema.json, and another to fixture-based tests under configs/schema/fixtures. Combining these checks in parallel reduces total validation time by nearly forty percent compared to a sequential approach.The YAML Validation stage invokes an AJV command with strict mode enforcement, ensuring any deviation in enum values, missing required properties, or incorrect data types is flagged before merge. We rely on flags such as --errors-distinct and --verbose to truncate duplicate errors and include full property paths in the build log, making it easier for authors to locate the precise line causing the failure. In tandem, the Fixture Tests stage runs ajv test against both valid and invalid JSON fixtures, verifying our regex patternProperties for vaultReference URIs and default value propagation for maxReceiveMessageSize. This two-pronged approach not only confirms that our live configurations conform to the schema, but also that any future schema evolution won’t inadvertently break existing validation rules.To provide real-time feedback, each parallel stage streams its outcome to the #devops-alerts Slack channel via the Jenkins slackSend plugin. A green check mark signifies that all files have passed validation, while a red cross commands immediate attention and includes a link to the full console output for rapid triage. By integrating these notifications, developers no longer need to poll build results; the pipeline proactively informs all stakeholders of any schema violations the moment they occur. This transparency reinforces our commitment to secure default values and Vault integration patterns, aligns with the documentation in the Secure Defaults and Vault Integration Guide, and accelerates our configuration change review process.Looking ahead, we plan to further extend this pipeline by integrating schema version tags into our YAML front matter and by automating the promotion of configurations that have successfully passed fixture tests. For now, the current setup strikes a balance between speed and coverage, ensuring that every pull request undergoes rigorous syntactic and semantic validation before merging. Team members interested in the technical details can reference the full pipeline DSL in Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy under the ci-config branch, and experiment with additional fixture cases to safeguard against future edge conditions.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-25T09:20:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Sierra Pine Rd"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Tisa Odonoghue","FirstName":"Tisa","JobTitle":"DevOps Engineer","LastName":"Odonoghue","MailNickName":"lod_tisaodon","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3287","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"742 Redwood Crossing"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Solutions Architecture","DisplayName":"Jason Adon","FirstName":"Jason","JobTitle":"Solutions Architect","LastName":"Adon","MailNickName":"lod_jasonadon","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3172","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"987 Willow Brook Path"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Era Manteca","FirstName":"Era","JobTitle":"Software Engineer","LastName":"Manteca","MailNickName":"lod_eramanteca","Manager":"lod_shakiag","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2822","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"147 Redwood Court"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Bev Mcginty","FirstName":"Bev","JobTitle":"QA Engineer","LastName":"Mcginty","MailNickName":"lod_bevmcg","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3345","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Cypress Court"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Sau Alquesta","FirstName":"Sau","JobTitle":"Platform Technical Lead","LastName":"Alquesta","MailNickName":"lod_saulq","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3012","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"987 Silver Oak Circle"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Solutions Architecture","DisplayName":"Terina Hafen","FirstName":"Terina","JobTitle":"Solutions Architect","LastName":"Hafen","MailNickName":"lod_terinahafen","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2765","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

The primary goal of this document is to capture the integration points between Jenkins, Snyk, Filebeat, Logstash, and Prometheus, and to articulate the design decisions that enable reliable scanning, reporting, and alerting.The first phase of the integration centers on the injection of the Snyk scan step into our Jenkins pipeline. Within the Post-Test-Gates stage, we invoke the shared security-scans library by calling runSnyk() immediately after compilation and unit testing. This approach ensures that vulnerability assessments occur before any artifacts are promoted. We leverage a withCredentials block to retrieve the SNYK_TOKEN secret, and the pipeline is configured to execute npm run build && mvn test && snyk test. By capturing the JSON output to stdout, we maintain a consistent invocation pattern that can be parsed downstream.Once the scan completes, the Go snippet developed by Emory Scherping captures the native Snyk JSON response and emits it as a series of structured log entries. This output is consumed by Filebeat’s multiline JSON parser, which aggregates the payload into coherent events. Our logstash.telemetry.conf, authored by Markita Sitra, applies a mutate filter that maps the exit code to @metadata.scan_status and extracts key metrics—such as the counts of medium, high, and critical vulnerabilities—into discrete fields. The use of metadata parsing ensures that we can replay and replay events without altering the underlying JSON structure.From Logstash, we forward enriched events to two distinct destinations: an artifact store and a Prometheus PushGateway. The artifact store retains a full Snyk report under builds/${BUILD_ID}/security/secure-scan-report.json for audit purposes, while the PushGateway accepts two metrics: security_scan_pass and security_scan_fail. We label each metric with build_id, commit_hash, and scan_status. This design enables Grafana dashboards to visualize failure rates over time and correlate build health with vulnerability trends. Additionally, alert rules in Prometheus trigger when we detect a new high or critical severity finding, enforcing immediate investigation protocols.To support compliance and policy tuning, we introduced a configurable threshold module that references our Confluence schema contract. Terina Hafen’s proposal to raise the critical severity block from zero to one is implemented via a policy file mutation step that precedes the Snyk invocation. This allows us to adjust thresholds without modifying the Jenkinsfile itself, reducing merge conflicts and centralizing policy management.Looking forward, the next phase will be to instrument downstream dashboards with anomaly detection on vulnerability incidence, and to extend our Filebeat-Logstash pipeline to capture remediation actions. We will also explore exporting Snyk scan trends to our central data warehouse for long-term analytics. By codifying each stage of this architecture, we ensure that security scanning remains a transparent, auditable, and continuous component of our CI/CD process.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-19T11:15:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-22T11:00:00Z","FileId":"8ad034b7-2a56-43af-8664-47e4230b6440","FileLocation":"files\\SecureSprint_PostSprint_Planning.docx","FileName":"SecureSprint_PostSprint_Planning.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-22T11:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_markitas","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_kerenguisbert","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_ashleyengel","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/Planning","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Title: Secure Sprint 2025-07-17 Post-Sprint Planning DocumentTable of Contents1.

Executive SummaryThis document consolidates our post-sprint planning for the Secure Sprint conducted on July 16–17, 2025, with the objective of fully operationalizing the DevSecOps enhancements integrated into our Jenkins pipeline. The sprint delivered automated Snyk scans in the Post-Test-Gates stage, cohesive telemetry ingestion via Filebeat and Logstash, and policy threshold adjustments proposed by Terina Hafen. Moving forward, this plan outlines key milestones, roles, and responsibilities to transition from the sprint phase to long-term DevSecOps governance and recurring execution.2. Pipeline Enhancement Roadmap2.1 Post-Test-Gates Snyk IntegrationDuring the sprint, we injected the security-scans shared library step immediately after compilation and unit testing, ensuring every pull request is assessed for vulnerabilities before downstream promotion. We must now extend this implementation across all development branches and refine pipeline parameters to toggle scans dynamically based on branch patterns and Confluence-based policy schemas. Figure 1 illustrates the stage flow with conditional logic for main, release, and feature branches.2.2 Filebeat & Logstash Telemetry FlowEmory Scherping’s Go snippet captures native Snyk JSON output and emits structured logs, which Filebeat aggregates using a multiline JSON parser. Markita Sitra’s Logstash mutation rule enriches events with @metadata.scan_status and vulnerability counts. The next phase involves hardening the parser against edge cases (e.g., truncated JSON frames) and extending Logstash to tag events with build metadata for seamless Prometheus metric emission.3. Vulnerability Assessment FrameworkTo ensure comprehensive coverage, we propose a multi-tier vulnerability assessment framework encompassing:• Tier 1: Automated Snyk Scans – Continuous execution in CI, gating builds on high and critical severities.• Tier 2: Policy-Driven Thresholds – Centralized policy files hosted in Confluence and fetched via REST API at pipeline runtime, enabling threshold adjustments without pipeline changes.• Tier 3: Manual Code Reviews – Periodic audits by Security Champions (e.g., Keren Guisbert and Ashley Engel) targeting flagged CVE paths and test coverage for error-handling branches.This framework will be codified in our internal Runbook, with process diagrams and decision trees for vulnerability triage and remediation timelines.4. Governance, Compliance, and Policy ManagementCompliance requirements necessitate detailed audit trails for each scan cycle. We will:• Implement audit logging in our CI system to capture scan metadata, exit codes, and policy versions.• Archive full Snyk JSON reports under builds/${BUILD_ID}/security/secure-sprint-scan-report.json and maintain retention policies aligned with regulatory standards.• Schedule quarterly policy reviews led by Terina Hafen to recalibrate severity thresholds and incorporate new CVE categories.This governance model ensures that DevSecOps practices are sustainable, auditable, and aligned with LiveOak Digital’s risk management objectives.5.

Contract Test Strategy and CI/CD Integration.....4\\n5. Phased Implementation Roadmap and Next Steps....5\\n\\n1. Executive Summary\\nThis planning document captures the detailed outcomes and action items from the User Profile and Notification Pipelines workshop conducted on May 20, 2025. The half day session brought together product management, front end, back end, DevOps, and solutions architecture teams to define the user profile APIs, error handling conventions, JWT verification flow, Kafka topic topology, and end to end contract testing approach. The agreed technical requirements, architecture diagrams, and contract definitions form the foundation for an iterative development and rollout plan aimed at enhancing system reliability and backward compatibility.\\n\\n2. Workshop Objectives and Scope\\nThe primary objectives of the workshop were to align on API surface specifications, define error response models, and establish a comprehensive contract test framework. Specific goals included verifying field validation rules for the GET profile endpoint, standardizing the details array schema, annotating the JWT verification path in the API gateway, and mapping Kafka topics for change feed capture. In addition, the workshop scoped out the CI/CD pipeline enhancements required to publish and verify Pact contracts, integrate spring cloud contract stub runners, and automate compatibility checks via Jenkins. The session concluded with ownership assignments and confirmation of deliverables timelines.\\n\\n3. Technical Architecture and Service Boundaries\\nThe architecture consists of four core microservices - user service, profile service, auth service, and notification service - connected via an API gateway and event broker. Figure 1 illustrates the service topology with data flow paths and JWT verification annotations. The gateway enforces token validation and injects user metadata headers before routing. Profile service stores user data in Postgres and emits change events to the user_updates Kafka topic. Notification service consumes notification_events and handles downstream push and email distribution. Each service will include Brave instrumentation for distributed tracing and will publish span data to Elasticsearch.\\n\\n4. Contract Test Strategy and CI/CD Integration\\nA robust contract testing framework is defined using Pact JVM and spring cloud contract. Initial provider contracts cover the GET and POST profile endpoints with validation rules for errorCode and details properties. Jenkins pipeline stages will execute pactVerify against a private Pact Broker, with credentials secured via Jenkins Credentials Binding and Vault integration. The pactPublish step will propagate updated contracts and trigger compatibility checks for both v1 and v2 JSON schema definitions. The CI stage will also include Ajv schema validations for example payloads and header assertions for X-Correlation-ID to enforce trace propagation.\\n\\n5. Phased Implementation Roadmap and Next Steps\\nPhase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Finalize JSON schema drafts, merge contract schema v1.0, and implement GET endpoint changes. Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Extend pagination enhancements for v2, integrate POST endpoint contract tests, and update Jenkins shared library. Phase 3 (Week 5): Conduct end to end smoke tests in staging, validate Kafka bootstrap scripts, and prepare release v1.0. Key dependencies include UX wireframe sign off, performance benchmarks for gateway JWT performance, and coordination with DevOps for topic provisioning. Action items have been assigned in the workshop minutes and are tracked under docs/architecture/user_profile/action_items.xlsx.","TimeStamp":"2025-05-21T10:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-02T10:00:00Z","FileId":"0005277a-0648-410d-a94c-42924759fafd","FileLocation":"files\\UserProfile_Workshop_Detailed_Outcomes.pptx","FileName":"UserProfile_Workshop_Detailed_Outcomes.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-02T10:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_missbj","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_tonycool","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_jackschrott","PermissionLevel":"edit"}],"FileDestination":"Presentations/Workshops","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title & OverviewTitle: User Profile & Notification Pipelines Workshop – Detailed OutcomesPresenter: Miss Bjorkman | Date: 2025-07-02Slide 2: Agenda1.

OverviewThis document outlines the detailed plan for finalizing and merging the feature/vault-integration branch into the main code line, scheduling production validation, and coordinating cross-team communication. It is intended for stakeholders in the Security, Platform, and Engineering teams to provide transparency on deliverables, dependencies, and timelines.2. Goals and ObjectivesThe primary objective is to ensure a seamless rollout of the vault integration enhancements developed over the past week. Key deliverables include the implementation of exponential backoff with jitter, a thread-safe LRU cache for AppRole tokens, and robust revocation logic to satisfy FISMA SI-10 controls. Secondary objectives are to update monitoring dashboards, verify Prometheus counters, and embed compliance references in Confluence and the runbook.3. Scope and DeliverablesDeliverables:- Pull request merge for parameterized securityGate.groovy and HVAC retry decorators- Execution of the staging smoke test matrix (vault_smoke_metrics.csv) with zero login failures- Wiki updates under “Security Library” featuring code samples for lock, stash, and revokeVaultToken- Confluence compliance mapping document linking every code change to the FISMA SI-10 checklist and SonarQube quality gates- Post-merge rollback procedures in the CI fragments runbook to disable vault stages if necessary4.

Roles and ResponsibilitiesJason Adon (Solutions Architect): Lead merge approval, schedule and host the July 24 sync meeting, update the runbook and compliance links.Shakia Gencarelli (Senior Software Engineer): Finalize the securityGate.groovy PR, execute TTL and guard-check tests, and update Jenkins shared library fragment.Sau Alquesta (Platform Technical Lead): Validate Grafana dashboard provisioning, coordinate DAST/SAST threshold parameterization, and confirm alert cooldown settings.Nila Tanguma (Engineering Manager): Oversee the overall risk assessment, sign off on compliance mapping, and ensure cross-team alignment.6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation StrategiesRisk: Vault token expiration during long-running jobs leading to stash/unstash failures. Mitigation: Increase default TTL to 3600 seconds, implement guard checks in the retry decorator, and document fallback procedures.Risk: Alert flapping on transient HTTP errors from Vault. Mitigation: Introduce jitter in the retry logic, update Grafana alerts with a 5-minute cooldown, and monitor vault_approle_login_failures_total for anomalies.Risk: Rollback plan not validated before merge. Mitigation: Conduct dry-run of disabling vault stages in a staging fragment, document steps in the runbook, and assign a rollback owner for on-call coverage.7. Communication PlanA 30-minute sync meeting (EventId: 239571e1-6fe5-4283-8957-2467e9bf28ce) is scheduled on July 24 at 3:00 PM PST to review final test results, address blocking issues, and confirm merge readiness. Post-merge status updates will be sent via email to the Security Pipeline distribution list, with the vault_smoke_metrics.csv report attached for visibility.8. Next Steps- Complete merge pull request and secure two independent code reviews by July 26 EOD.- Execute production smoke tests immediately after merge and distribute findings by July 27 EOD.- Update Confluence pages with final architecture diagrams and direct links to compliance artifacts.- Monitor vault operations in production for 48 hours and report any anomalies to the Platform on-call rotation.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-24T22:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-24T18:00:00Z","FileId":"d87e372a-3cc6-4c2b-8eb5-dd241d3cf07d","FileLocation":"files\\Security_Pipeline_Integration_Deep_Dive.pptx","FileName":"Security_Pipeline_Integration_Deep_Dive.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-24T18:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_jasonadon","SharedWith":null,"FileDestination":"Presentations/SecurityPipeline","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title & Introduction- Title: Security Pipeline Integration Deep Dive & Outcome Review- Date: 2025-07-24- Presenter: Jason AdonSlide 2: Smoke Test Metrics OverviewReference: vault_smoke_metrics.csv (FileId: 90d31266-79f3-41a1-b684-3e3b079cf648)• AppRole logins per axis: 1• Stash/Unstash operations per axis: 8• Prometheus counters: vault_approle_login_attempts_total=16, vault_approle_login_failures_total=0Slide 3: Compliance Update ImpactLink: Security_Pipeline_Compliance_Update.pdf (FileId: 1f33754a-e972-48ba-b0f7-0cc32bc25046)• CVE-2025-1401 & CVE-2025-1415 mitigation steps applied• In-memory LRU cache TTL rotation enforcement• Jitter backoff implemented in HVAC retry decoratorSlide 4: Jenkins Shared Library Enhancements• Added exponential backoff with jitter (initialDelay=1s, factor=2)• Cached AppRole token in thread-safe LRU cache• Parameterized DAST/SAST thresholds via environment variables• Added checksum validation for coverage-summary.jsonSlide 5: Infographic: AppRole Login Reduction┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐│ AppRole Logins per Hour (Before vs After) ││     Time      | Before | After          ││  07:00–07:24  | 200    | 16             ││  07:24–08:00  | 180    | 16             │└───────────────────────────────────────────┘Slide 6: Next Steps & Action ItemsID   | Description                                     | Owner     | Due Date   | Status-----|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------AI-201 | Finalize TTL parameter PR in securityGate.groovy | shakiag   | 2025-07-25 | In ProgressAI-202 | Merge fetchAwsCredentials integration           | jasonadon | 2025-07-27 | PlannedAI-203 | Sync rollout feedback with Platform team        | jasonadon | 2025-07-24 | ScheduledSlide 7: Supporting Artifacts- compliance_update_v2.pdf (FileId: 1f33754a-e972-48ba-b0f7-0cc32bc25046)- vault_smoke_metrics.csv (FileId: 90d31266-79f3-41a1-b684-3e3b079cf648)- CI fragment: docs/ci/fragments/securityGate.groovyEnd of Presentation","TimeStamp":"2025-07-24T18:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-25T16:00:00Z","FileId":"c8bbeec2-5480-4c24-8cb0-ba676c6db60b","FileLocation":"files\\Vault_Integration_Outcomes_and_Infographic.pptx","FileName":"Vault_Integration_Outcomes_and_Infographic.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-25T16:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_jasonadon","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_loriaf","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_shawnnas","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"SecurityPipeline/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title & Overview- Title: Vault Integration Outcomes & Infographic Review- Presenter: Jason Adon- Date: 2025-07-25- Objective: Summarize vault integration enhancements, performance gains, compliance statusSlide 2: Agenda1.

The workshop aimed to standardize vulnerability scanning across CI/CD pipelines. We explore the methodologies, tool evaluation metrics, stakeholder roles, and operational SLOs defined during the session.Keywords: CI/CD, vulnerability scanning, DevSecOps, SLO, pipeline integration.1. IntroductionVulnerability scanning in modern DevOps environments is essential for early detection of security flaws [1]. Integrating scanning tools directly into CI/CD pipelines reduces feedback loops and ensures consistent policy enforcement. However, a lack of standardized approaches leads to coverage gaps and performance overhead [2].2. Related WorkPrevious studies have evaluated security automation frameworks [3], while container scanning tools have been compared in controlled settings [4]. The workshop discussed herein builds on these foundations by addressing cross-functional collaboration and real-time requirements elicitation.3. Workshop Context and MethodologyOn July 16, 2025, a three-hour workshop was conducted with participants from Engineering, Product Management, and UX/UI Design (Event ID d90f6c1d-ac87-4d87-87ba-98105737c7a5). Facilitated by Shakia Gencarelli, the agenda included defining business and security objectives, mapping stakeholder responsibilities, and drafting UI acceptance criteria. Data was collected via live Confluence updates (EngineeringDocuments/Plans/Vulnerability_Scan_Ingestion_Requirements.md).3.1 Stakeholders and RolesKey contributors: Shakia Gencarelli (CI integration owner), Era Manteca (tool evaluation), Wilford Taussig (DevOps automation), Lura Gerdts (UX/UI reporting), Ossie Ziller (release gating).4. Standardization FrameworkParticipants agreed on a framework comprising artifact coverage scopes, failure thresholds (false positives <2%), API rate-limit handling (Clair: 60 req/min, Snyk: 100 req/min), and performance SLOs (P95 latency ≤60s, build time increase ≤5%). This aligns with OWASP DevSecOps guidelines [5].5. CI/CD Pipeline Integration PatternsWe recommend a modular Jenkins shared library with method signatures: scanWithSnyk(projectDir, thresholds), scanWithClair(imageReference), publishVulnerabilityMetrics(jobName). A yaml.safe_load validation step was introduced to enforce schema correctness pre-submission.6. Tool Evaluation MetricsA comparative matrix ranked tools on vulnerability coverage, scan speed, integration complexity, and license cost. Snyk excelled in IaC scanning, while Clair provided robust container drift analysis. Trivy was included for Kubernetes YAML support. Metrics were normalized using a weighted scoring algorithm [6].7. Operational Metrics and SLOsTo monitor pipeline efficacy, key metrics include: vulnerability_count_by_severity, scan_error_rate, scan_latency_histogram. Grafana panels were defined to alert on thresholds: sustained P95 >60s, false positive rate >5%. These metrics are captured via publishVulnerabilityMetrics in the shared library.8. DiscussionThe collaborative approach ensured rapid consensus and traceability. Real-time Confluence updates foster transparency, but introduced context-switching overhead. Future sessions may incorporate asynchronous pre-work to optimize time.9. Conclusion and Future DirectionsStandardizing vulnerability scanning across CI/CD pipelines is achievable through defined frameworks, tool metrics, and shared libraries. Further research will evaluate the long-term impact on security posture and developer productivity.References[1] Martinez, A., et al., \"Continuous Security in DevOps\", Journal of Secure Software Engineering, 2023.[2] Smith, B., Johnson, C., \"Comparative Analysis of Container Scanners\", Proc.

The narrative begins by tracing the modular design decisions that led to a maintainable shared library architecture, then drills into the implementation of each core utility method and concludes with integration examples and operational considerations.At the heart of our approach lies a Groovy-based shared library that encapsulates four primary functions: scanWithSnyk, scanWithClair, publishVulnerabilityMetrics, and validatePipelineSchema. The library is organized under src/com/liveoakdevsecops with each method in its own class, accompanied by unit tests in src/test/groovy. We leverage Jenkins classpath isolation and library versioning so that teams can pin to a stable release (e.g., 1.2.0) while updates to the library are published to Artifactory. This separation ensures that incremental enhancements—such as adding new threshold parameters or supporting a secondary scanner—do not disrupt existing pipelines.The scanWithSnyk function is implemented as a thin wrapper around the Snyk CLI, accepting a workspace path and a map of thresholds for project directories. Internally, it constructs a command line string that injects P95 latency and false positive thresholds, then captures SARIF output and archives it to a build artifact folder. The scanWithClair method follows a similar structure but uses Docker to spin up a local Clair service, pipes in the container image reference, and generates JSON results which are then converted to Prometheus counters. The publishVulnerabilityMetrics method collects key metrics—vulnerability_count_by_severity, scan_error_rate, and scan_latency_histogram—from the workspace and pushes them to the Jenkins metrics plugin. The validatePipelineSchema method employs a yaml.safe_load call against our JSON Schema definitions, ensuring that any missing required stages or malformed environment blocks cause a pipeline failure with actionable error messages.To illustrate integration, consider a declarative Jenkinsfile snippet: pipeline { agent any; stages { stage('Validate Config') { steps { sharedLibrary.validatePipelineSchema('schemas/pipeline-schema.json', 'Jenkinsfile') } } stage('Scan') { environment { THRESHOLDS = credentials('scan-thresholds') } steps { sharedLibrary.scanWithSnyk(env.WORKSPACE, THRESHOLDS); sharedLibrary.scanWithClair(env.IMAGE_REF); sharedLibrary.publishVulnerabilityMetrics(env.JOB_NAME) } } } } The shared library automatically loads via the @Library annotation, and the methods handle exit codes and logging according to our team conventions. Engineers are advised to parameterize threshold values via Jenkins credentials or parameterized builds, ensuring repeatable runs across branches and environments. By following this deep dive, teams will be equipped to extend the library for new scanning tools, integrate custom Prometheus recording rules, and maintain consistency in CI/CD vulnerability enforcement across LiveOak Digital’s engineering organization.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-19T09:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-18T10:00:00Z","FileId":"bdf123e1-f648-461f-8470-70c5ad06c6e1","FileLocation":"files\\SecureSprint_DevSecOps_Outcomes_Presentation.pdf","FileName":"SecureSprint_DevSecOps_Outcomes_Presentation.pdf","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-18T10:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_markitas","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_kerenguisbert","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_ashleyengel","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/Retrospectives","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Presentation Title: Secure Sprint 2025-07-17 DevSecOps Integration OutcomesSlide 1: Title Slide- Secure Sprint Retrospective: DevSecOps Integration & CI/CD Hardening- Date: July 18, 2025- Presenter: Shakia Gencarelli (shakiag@liveoakdigital.com)- Team: LiveOak Digital EngineeringSlide 2: Agenda1.

The primary goal of this document is to capture the integration points between Jenkins, Snyk, Filebeat, Logstash, and Prometheus, and to articulate the design decisions that enable reliable scanning, reporting, and alerting.The first phase of the integration centers on the injection of the Snyk scan step into our Jenkins pipeline. Within the Post-Test-Gates stage, we invoke the shared security-scans library by calling runSnyk() immediately after compilation and unit testing. This approach ensures that vulnerability assessments occur before any artifacts are promoted. We leverage a withCredentials block to retrieve the SNYK_TOKEN secret, and the pipeline is configured to execute npm run build && mvn test && snyk test. By capturing the JSON output to stdout, we maintain a consistent invocation pattern that can be parsed downstream.Once the scan completes, the Go snippet developed by Emory Scherping captures the native Snyk JSON response and emits it as a series of structured log entries. This output is consumed by Filebeat’s multiline JSON parser, which aggregates the payload into coherent events. Our logstash.telemetry.conf, authored by Markita Sitra, applies a mutate filter that maps the exit code to @metadata.scan_status and extracts key metrics—such as the counts of medium, high, and critical vulnerabilities—into discrete fields. The use of metadata parsing ensures that we can replay and replay events without altering the underlying JSON structure.From Logstash, we forward enriched events to two distinct destinations: an artifact store and a Prometheus PushGateway. The artifact store retains a full Snyk report under builds/${BUILD_ID}/security/secure-scan-report.json for audit purposes, while the PushGateway accepts two metrics: security_scan_pass and security_scan_fail. We label each metric with build_id, commit_hash, and scan_status. This design enables Grafana dashboards to visualize failure rates over time and correlate build health with vulnerability trends. Additionally, alert rules in Prometheus trigger when we detect a new high or critical severity finding, enforcing immediate investigation protocols.To support compliance and policy tuning, we introduced a configurable threshold module that references our Confluence schema contract. Terina Hafen’s proposal to raise the critical severity block from zero to one is implemented via a policy file mutation step that precedes the Snyk invocation. This allows us to adjust thresholds without modifying the Jenkinsfile itself, reducing merge conflicts and centralizing policy management.Looking forward, the next phase will be to instrument downstream dashboards with anomaly detection on vulnerability incidence, and to extend our Filebeat-Logstash pipeline to capture remediation actions. We will also explore exporting Snyk scan trends to our central data warehouse for long-term analytics. By codifying each stage of this architecture, we ensure that security scanning remains a transparent, auditable, and continuous component of our CI/CD process.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-19T11:15:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"123 LiveOak Way"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Shakia Gencarelli","FirstName":"Shakia","JobTitle":"Senior Software Engineer","LastName":"Gencarelli","MailNickName":"lod_shakiag","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2749","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

During that session, we identified a race condition under cold-cache eviction that triggered excessive eviction warnings and violated our 200 ms SLA for authentication requests. To mitigate this, the engineering team proposed a dynamic resizing algorithm driven by real-time CPU utilization metrics.The core of the prototype centers on a feedback loop that adjusts the cache capacity at runtime. We integrated a Prometheus gauge for system CPU utilization polled every five seconds, and established lower and upper bounds of forty and seventy percent respectively. When utilization exceeds the upper threshold, the cache manager increments capacity by one hundred entries; when it falls below the lower threshold, it decrements by the same step. This approach maintains a balance between eviction frequency and memory consumption without manual intervention.Integration of this algorithm into the existing JwtCacheManager required careful attention to thread safety and non-blocking operations. We extended the cache implementation to emit a new Prometheus counter, ci_cache_resize_invocations_total, which tracks each resize operation along with the associated cache_size label. Management endpoints for clearCache and exposeMetrics enable external tools to simulate cold-start scenarios and validate resizing behavior under controlled conditions.To ensure robust validation, the prototype underwent a two-tier testing strategy. First, unit tests in auth_service/tests/test_jwt_cache_perf.py were enhanced with synthetic load scenarios that sequentially exercise warm and cold cache states, measuring average latencies against our targets of under 1.2 ms and under 4.5 ms respectively. Second, the Jenkins pipeline was updated to include a waitForVaultReady stage followed by a synthetic load runner that executes one thousand iterations and fails the build if P95 cold-cache latency exceeds three milliseconds. These measures guard against regressions and surface performance deviations early in the CI cycle.Observability of the dynamic resizing behavior is facilitated through Grafana dashboards with two complementary panels. The first panel visualizes total resize invocations over a five-minute window, and the second slices invocations by cache_size label in a heatmap format.

A rapid response uncovered two primary contributors: an HPA resource request misconfiguration capping pods at three and an overly aggressive exponential backoff algorithm in //libs/transaction/retry.go without proper jitter. This one-pager dives into the technical changes that restored stable throughput at 300 QPS with p95 latency under 120 ms.HPA Configuration TuningWe adjusted the Kubernetes HPA CPU request from 100 m to 200 m and lowered the target utilization threshold from 70% to 55%. Scaling tests showed that under a 300 QPS traffic pattern, the pods now scale from three to five replicas in approximately 50 seconds, matching scale-up targets. A 180-second downscale stabilization window prevents thrash during oscillating loads. Terraform PR #216 includes the updated module parameters and a new runbook section documenting the deployment steps and rollback procedures.Retry Backoff ImprovementsThe retry library has been refactored to use a base delay of 50 ms, capped at 150 ms, and supplemented with uniform jitter in the range of 0–100 ms. This change smooths out retry bursts when downstream Kafka brokers return HTTP 429, eliminating execution stalls. Unit and benchmark tests now cover rapid 429 sequences, confirming a 20% reduction in tail delay. Prometheus histogram buckets have been updated to surface sub-50 ms latency distributions and a new 150 ms bucket for rapid diagnostics.Combined Resiliency OutcomesBy synchronizing HPA tuning with refined backoff logic, we achieved stable pod counts, consistent p95 latencies below 120 ms, and zero connection exhaustion events in production. Next steps include integrating these metrics into our Grafana dashboards, automating alert thresholds for both CPU utilization and retry delay distributions, and conducting canary validations in staging.

p99 latency spike of 1.2s under a consistent 200 QPS load due to an HPA CPU request misconfiguration and an unbounded exponential backoff algorithm without jitter. This one-pager provides a technical breakdown of the scaling adjustments and retry logic enhancements that resolved the incident and the next steps for long-term resilience.HPA Configuration Tuning: We increased the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler CPU request from 100m to 200m and lowered the target utilization threshold from 70 percent to 55 percent. A 180 second downscale stabilization window was added to prevent thrashing during transient load dips. In our HPA and Backoff Test Results for iteration seven, these changes reduced scale up time to 40 seconds at 300 QPS and scale down time to 150 seconds, with p95 latency under 120 milliseconds and error rate below 0.5 percent.Retry Backoff Improvements: The retry library in libs/transaction/retry.go was refactored to implement a base delay of 50 milliseconds, cap at 150 milliseconds, and uniform jitter up to 100 milliseconds.

As our platform responds to varying load conditions, it is critical to ensure that capacity adjustments do not introduce instability. Thrash prevention is achieved by enforcing a configurable cooldown period between resize operations and by monitoring resize events to warn when thresholds are exceeded.In a dynamic resizing model, the cache adapts its capacity in response to miss-rate and CPU utilization metrics. When the miss-rate exceeds the defined threshold over the evaluation window, the cache increases its size by the up_size parameter. Similarly, when CPU usage climbs above its threshold and the hit-rate remains high, the cache decreases in size. Without proper controls, these adjustments can oscillate rapidly, leading to cache thrashing and unpredictable performance.To mitigate this risk, the cache_settings.yaml schema includes a cooldown_period property that defines the minimum interval between successive resize actions. This period is measured from the timestamp of the last applied resize event. During this interval, further resize triggers are ignored, and any attempts to adjust the cache size increment a thrash warning counter. By capturing these events in jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, we gain visibility into how often resize requests are suppressed.The CacheResizerService in the authentication microservice implements this logic. After fetching metrics from Prometheus via the metrics client, it evaluates conditions such as:    long elapsed = now - lastResizeTime;    if (missRate > config.getMissThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize + config.getUpSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else if (cpuUtil > config.getCpuThreshold() && hitRate > config.getHitThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize - config.getDownSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else {        thrashWarningsCounter.increment();    }This approach ensures that cache size adjustments occur no more frequently than configured, and that any suppressed triggers are accounted for. The updateCapacity method performs boundary checks against minCapacity and maxCapacity before applying changes.On the monitoring side, we introduce a Prometheus recording rule that accumulates jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, and a Grafana panel that overlays the warning counter with jwt_cache_current_size. This correlation allows engineers to quickly identify periods where the cache reached its cooldown limit. An alert can be configured to fire when thrash warnings increment multiple times within a short timeframe, indicating that operational thresholds may need tuning.Finally, we integrate thrash regression tests into our CI pipeline. The test suite simulates continuous miss-rate spikes and verifies that no more than one resize event occurs per cooldown period. This is achieved by injecting mock metrics and advancing the internal clock within the CacheResizerService. Any deviation from expected behavior fails the build, providing immediate feedback.In production, runbook procedures include instructions to inspect the thrash warning metrics and to adjust cooldown settings if necessary. By combining configuration controls, robust implementation, and comprehensive monitoring, we ensure that dynamic resizing enhances cache efficiency without sacrificing system stability.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-29T08:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-29T14:00:00Z","FileId":"8dda7b85-25b5-402d-a0f6-67e4afb32c62","FileLocation":"files\\otlp-exporter-performance-study.pdf","FileName":"otlp-exporter-performance-study.pdf","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-29T14:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_eramanteca","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_oziller","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Research","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Title: Evaluating OTLP gRPC Exporter Performance in Cloud-native Telemetry PipelinesAuthors: Shakia GencarelliAffiliation: LiveOak Digital EngineeringDate: July 29, 2025AbstractThe OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) has emerged as a standard for exporting telemetry data in cloud-native environments. In this paper, we evaluate the performance characteristics of the OTLP gRPC exporter versus a traditional Kafka-based exporter under microservices workloads. We measure latency, throughput, CPU and memory usage, and reliability across multiple scenarios. Our findings reveal that the OTLP gRPC exporter offers lower latency by up to 15% at the cost of a 10% increase in CPU utilization compared to Kafka. We discuss implications for designing observability pipelines and propose best practices for deployment [1] [2].1. IntroductionObservability in distributed systems relies on ingesting telemetry data with minimal overhead. While OTLP provides a vendor-neutral protocol, many organizations continue to use Kafka as a scalable transport layer [3]. This study addresses the lack of empirical benchmarks comparing these exporters in real-world settings.2. Background and Related WorkPrior research has explored gRPC performance in RPC frameworks [4], and Kafka’s role in telemetry architectures [5]. However, there is limited work directly comparing these approaches for metrics and trace export in high-throughput environments.3. MethodologyWe instrumented a sample microservice application generating 10,000 metrics per second. Two exporters were configured: OTLP gRPC direct to Collector, and Kafka appender with a dedicated cluster. Tests were conducted on m5.large EC2 instances over a network latency emulation of 10-50 ms. We collected end-to-end latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99), CPU, memory, and error rates over 1-hour runs.4. ResultsOTLP gRPC average P95 latency was 120 ms, compared to 140 ms for Kafka. At high load, P99 latencies diverged: 200 ms for gRPC, 250 ms for Kafka. CPU utilization averaged 65% for gRPC, 55% for Kafka, while memory usage remained within 10% difference. Both exporters achieved >99.9% delivery success rate.5. DiscussionThe lower latency of gRPC makes it suitable for low-latency observability requirements. However, Kafka’s burst buffering can absorb spikes, providing smoother throughput. We recommend hybrid architectures that leverage OTLP for real-time telemetry and Kafka for batch processing.6. ConclusionThis study provides actionable insights for observability pipeline design.

Extending the preliminary performance data from Gencarelli et al. [1], we provide additional benchmarks under varying network jitter, compression settings, and batch sizes. We also propose a reference implementation addressing backpressure, retry policies, and fail-fast semantics suitable for enterprise deployments.1. IntroductionTelemetry is a critical component for observability in distributed microservice architectures. The OTLP gRPC exporter offers vendor-neutral transport with lower latency compared to traditional message brokers like Kafka [2]. During the OTLP Exporter Q&A Roundtable on July 29, 2025 [3], our team discussed batch sizes of 512 and 1024 spans, gzip compression impact, network jitter up to 100 ms, and P95/P99 latency under sustained 10 k metrics/s loads. Building on those findings, this paper examines end-to-end performance, resource utilization, and resiliency under real-world conditions.2. Background and Related WorkPrevious work on gRPC performance in telemetry contexts highlights sub-millisecond RPC overhead [4]. Brown and Davis demonstrated gRPC latency advantages over HTTP/1.1 in RPC frameworks [5]. However, most studies focus on RPC workloads, not high-volume telemetry streams. Gencarelli’s initial study compared OTLP gRPC to Kafka-based export patterns, showing 15% latency reduction and 10% CPU overhead increase [1]. This paper fills the gap by evaluating jitter robustness, backpressure behavior, and retry policy efficacy in production-like scenarios.3. Design Considerations3.1 Batch SizingBatch size directly influences latency and CPU usage. Our extended tests use 512, 1024, and 2048 spans per batch under 10 k–50 k metrics/s loads. We observe diminishing returns beyond 1024 spans, consistent with sustainedLoad_10000mps_NoJitter_1024 benchmarks [6]. We recommend 1024 as a default, with 2048 for bursty workloads.3.2 Compression TradeoffsGzip compression reduces network payload by 60% but increases CPU utilization by 3–8% and memory overhead by ~8 MB per endpoint [3]. Our memory profiles under 10 k metrics/s loads confirm stable utilization with gzip, but CPU peaks approach 68% on m5.large instances. We propose an opt-in compression flag and runtime toggle for dynamic enabling based on CPU headroom.3.3 Backpressure and RetryIn collector queue-full scenarios, the OTLP exporter blocks gRPC threads, risking throughput collapse [3]. We implement an asynchronous buffer with configurable size and drop-oldest policy to decouple exporter threads. Retry policies use exponential backoff with jitter, configurable in service.yaml under protocol.grpc.retry_policy. Our tests show 99.95% success rates under 50–100 ms jitter with retry enabled.4. Performance Evaluation4.1 Test SetupWe instrumented a microservice generating 20 k metrics/s per instance on Kubernetes. Network latency emulation ranged 0–200 ms jitter. Metrics were collected via HashiCorp’s network emulation for consistency.4.2 ResultsTable 1 summarizes latency and resource usage across scenarios. Under 50–100 ms jitter, P95 latency stayed under 160 ms with batch size 1024 and gzip off, and under 165 ms with gzip on (memory +8 MB overhead). P99 spikes remained under 300 ms in both cases. CPU peaked at 63% without compression, 68% with.4.3 DiscussionThe results validate that OTLP gRPC exporter meets sub-200 ms P95 latency SLAs even under moderate jitter. Batching and compression settings should be tuned per workload. Asynchronous senders prevent backpressure effects, and configurable retry policies ensure delivery durability.5. Deployment Best Practices• Default exporter type: grpc; fallback to kafka via service loader SPI for hybrid architectures.• Batch size configuration: 1024 spans; override via exporter.batchSize parameter.• Compression: disabled by default; enableGrpcCompression flag to opt in.• Backpressure: configure exporter.asyncBufferSize; drop-oldest policy recommended.• Retry: exponential backoff with configurable initialInterval and maxRetries.• Monitoring: expose otlp_exporter_metrics; track HighJitterP99 and ExporterBackpressureDropped metrics in Prometheus.• Security: mTLS enforced via Vault cert rotation; test rotation under load to ensure session continuity.6. ConclusionIntegrating OTLP gRPC exporter into large-scale telemetry pipelines yields significant latency improvements with manageable resource overhead. The reference design presented here addresses common pain points in backpressure, retry, and resource tuning, enabling robust enterprise observability. Future work includes exploring multiplexed HTTP/2 streams and adaptive batch sizing algorithms.References[1] Shakia Gencarelli, \"Evaluating OTLP gRPC Exporter Performance in Cloud-native Telemetry Pipelines,\" LiveOak Digital Engineering, July 2025.[2] John Smith et al., \"OpenTelemetry Best Practices,\" Int.

During the session, the LiveOak Digital engineering team reviewed performance benchmarks comparing the OTLP gRPC exporter with Kafka under high-throughput workloads. Shakia Gencarelli and Danille Ciardullo led discussions on optimizing batch sizes, compression settings, and network jitter resilience. Attendees included Emory Scherping, Miss Bjorkman, Ashley Engel, Porsha Brodbeck, and Myles Mckoan, all of whom contributed real-world test data and use cases.Our analysis confirms that a batch size of 1024 spans strikes the best balance between latency and resource utilization. Benchmarks show P95 latency stabilizes at 120ms under a sustained 10k metrics/s load, with P99 under 300ms even with 50-100ms network jitter when using optimized batch settings. Enabling gzip compression reduces bandwidth by approximately 60% but increases peak CPU utilization from 65% to 68% and incurs an additional 8MB of memory overhead per endpoint. We recommend an opt-in flag for compression and default batch_size=1024 in the OTLP receiver configuration.To address backpressure and reliability, the document details implementing an asynchronous exporter buffer with a drop-oldest policy to decouple the gRPC export threads from collector queue capacity. Service yaml examples illustrate configuring exponential backoff retry policies under protocol.grpc.retry_policy, ensuring 99.95% delivery success rates during transient network conditions. These settings prevent exporter thread blocking and improve overall pipeline resiliency.Next steps include updating the Confluence telemetry integration guide to reflect these best practices, extending the Helm chart sidecar configuration to expose HPA parameters, and integrating the performance infographic from the OTLP_Exporter_QA_Outcomes presentation. Action items are assigned to streamline adoption: Emory to draft meeting minutes, Danille to update guide section 4.2, Porsha to schedule additional jitter benchmarks, Myles to develop Grafana correlation panels, and Ashley to document memory impact in CI tests.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-30T10:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-30T11:00:00Z","FileId":"0939cfd9-caff-4581-8fab-57ad727ee0f1","FileLocation":"files\\OTLP_Exporter_QA_Perf_DeepDive_OnePager.docx","FileName":"OTLP_Exporter_QA_Perf_DeepDive_OnePager.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-30T11:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_missbj","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_ashleyengel","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_porshab","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_mylesm","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/OnePagers","DestinationType":"site","Content":"OTLP gRPC Exporter Performance Deep DiveThis one-pager provides an in-depth analysis of the performance and resiliency aspects of the OTLP gRPC exporter, building on the findings from the OTLP Exporter Q&A Roundtable held on July 29, 2025. It consolidates benchmark data, operational trade-offs, and configuration best practices into concise recommendations for enterprise-grade telemetry pipelines.Backpressure Mitigation and Async BufferingCollector queue saturation under high load can block gRPC exporter threads and degrade end-to-end latency. We introduced an asynchronous in-memory buffer with configurable bufferCapacity and a drop-oldest fallback policy. In stress tests simulating sustained 10 000 metrics/s loads, a bufferCapacity of 1024 spans maintained P95 latencies within 160 ms, compared to 180 ms when unbuffered. This buffering approach decouples exporter throughput from collector queue limits and prevents tail-latency spikes.Batch Sizing and Compression Trade-offsTests with batch sizes of 512, 1024, and 2048 spans demonstrate diminishing latency gains beyond 1024 spans. P95 latencies improved from 140 ms (512) to 120 ms (1024) and to 115 ms (2048), while CPU utilization increased from 60 % to 63 % to 65 % respectively. Enabling gzip compression reduces network payloads by approximately 60 % but introduces a 3–8 % CPU overhead and ~8 MB memory overhead per endpoint. We recommend default batchSize=1024 and an opt-in compression flag (enableGrpcCompression=false) to balance resource usage.Jitter Resilience and Retry PoliciesUnder 50–100 ms network jitter, P99 latencies stayed below 300 ms when leveraging batchSize=1024, async buffering, and an exponential backoff retry policy (initialInterval=1s; maxRetries=5). The exporter achieved 99.95 % delivery success. Continuous monitoring of Prometheus metrics HighJitterP99 and ExporterBackpressureDropped is critical for validating production behavior.

IntroductionThis workshop is designed to build upon the foundational configuration standards work performed on 2025-07-23 and refined through subsequent deep dives. We will explore the integration of secure default values, Vault secret reference patterns, advanced JSON Schema features, and automated validation pipelines. Participants will gain hands-on experience with crafting schema rules, patternProperties, and integrating AJV into Jenkins for real-time feedback.2. Workshop ObjectivesThe primary objectives of the session are to: • Solidify safe defaults enforcement by extending the telemetry-config schema to include default values for key properties. • Demonstrate how to author and test patternProperties for vaultReference URIs to prevent misconfiguration. • Walk through the Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy pipeline snippet, focusing on parallel fixture tests, verbose error reporting, and Slack notification integration. • Provide guided exercises that replicate real-world scenarios, including pushing sample YML snippets with both valid and invalid vault URIs. • Establish a clear post-workshop action plan, assigning ownership for rolling out changes across additional repositories and service teams.3. Agenda OverviewThe workshop will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM PST on 2025-07-27 in Teams Meeting format. High-level agenda: • 2:00 – 2:15 PM: Opening remarks and recapitulation of prior sessions. • 2:15 – 3:00 PM: Secure Defaults deep dive: Vault KV patterns and kebab-case conventions. • 3:00 – 3:45 PM: JSON Schema patternProperties: advanced use cases and edge conditions. • 3:45 – 4:00 PM: Break. • 4:00 – 4:45 PM: Hands-on lab: AJV validate and test commands in CI pipeline with fixtures. • 4:45 – 5:00 PM: Wrap-up, Q&A, and assignment of follow-up tasks.4. Detailed Session Breakdown4.1 Secure Defaults & Vault Reference PatternsWe will begin by revisiting the Vault secret reference patterns introduced in PR #127 and #130, examining the regex ^vault://secret/data/[\\\\w/]+#[\\\\w-]+$ and its placement under the vaultReference node. Attendees will modify example auth-config snippets to practice enforcing version:2 defaults and validate them against the schema using ajv validate --strict. We will discuss the implications of object merging in patternProperties and how to scope regex tests to specific nodes, ensuring that unintentional mutations do not compromise security agreements.4.2 JSON Schema Enhancements & PatternPropertiesThis section delves into the modifications in configs/schema/telemetry-config-schema.json. We will walk through the insertion of default: 1048576 for maxReceiveMessageSize and the addition of a patternProperties block. Using the Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy parallel stage, participants will observe how invalid URIs are flagged and how fixture tests under configs/schema/fixtures provide coverage for both positive and negative cases. We will analyze sample fixture error logs to identify full data paths in verbose AJV output and refine the schema accordingly, strengthening maintainability and reducing ambiguous validation failures.4.3 AJV Pipeline Integration & Fixture TestsBuilding on section 4.2, the focus shifts to integrating AJV into a CI/CD pipeline. We will examine the complete pipeline DSL and execute a live run of the schema validation stage, demonstrating the --errors-distinct and --verbose flags. Attendees will create a minimal Jenkinsfile snippet, commit to a feature branch, and observe real-time notifications in #devops-alerts. Emphasis will be placed on reducing validation time through parallel stages, optimizing test fixture design, and leveraging Slack notifications for immediate feedback.5. Pre-Workshop Preparation and Required ArtifactsParticipants should complete the following prerequisites before the workshop begins: • Clone the telemetry-config and ci-config repositories and switch to the schema-validation branch. • Review the Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx (FileId: 9d6fb2b4-be42-4061-8b5f-3df08c2b6766) and Config_Change_Log.xlsx (FileId: 106554d5-ad9b-4972-863e-ad73a5fbd6fd). • Ensure a working Jenkins environment with the AJV CLI installed and Slack integration configured. • Validate access to configs/schema/fixtures for the JSON test suite, including valid-vaultReference.json and invalid-vaultReference.json.6. Post-Workshop Deliverables and Follow-Up ActionsAfter the session, attendees are expected to: • Merge approved schema patches into the main branch and bump the telemetry-config version. • Update the Confluence “Configuration File Best Practices” page with code examples and CI pipeline snippets. • Assign follow-up tasks in Jira: AI-132 for patternProperties review, AI-133 for Vault integration enhancements, and AI-134 for cross-service rollout. • Monitor the #devops-alerts channel for validation results and CI feedback on additional repositories.Appendix A: Reference Materials • Secure Defaults and Vault Integration Guide: https://liveoak.sharepoint.com/sites/devops/Shared%20Documents/DevOps/Guides/Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx • Schema Validation Pipeline DSL: Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy (FileId: 568a72db-7e31-46f8-957d-b41ccb9caa4e) • Infographic: Indentation_Impact.png (FileId: 6a0afa1b-4910-4672-ad27-43740439d35b) • Deep Dive Slides: Config_Schema_DeepDive_Slides.pptx (FileId: 09990c7a-8ef8-48e1-9c53-dc6a215b0784)","TimeStamp":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-23T17:05:00Z","FileId":"9d6fb2b4-be42-4061-8b5f-3df08c2b6766","FileLocation":"files\\Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx","FileName":"Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-23T17:05:00Z","Owner":"lod_tisaodon","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_jasonadon","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/DevOps/Guides","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Ensuring that all configuration files utilize secure default values is essential to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of our deployment pipelines. The Secure Defaults and Vault Integration Guide builds on the recent changes introduced in PR #127 and #128 to illustrate an end-to-end workflow for substituting placeholder credentials with dynamic secret references in telemetry-config. The document describes how to configure the vaultSecretEngine YAML parameter to point to `vault://secret/data/ci/feature-flags#rollout-tokens` and enforce the `version:2` attribute as a mandatory field. It offers a complete example showing the correct indentation using two spaces per level, aligning with our YAML style guide, and demonstrates the automatic fallback to a secure default when the Jenkins pipeline variable DEPLOY_ENV is unset. The guide also highlights the corrected kebab-case naming convention for feature flags, such as `enable-feature-x`, and explains how these patterns are validated against our Confluence page at EngineeringDocuments/Standards/ConfigNamingConventions.To verify that secrets are retrieved correctly, the guide includes a snippet of the Jenkinsfile stage that invokes the Vault CLI to fetch the secret before rendering the final configuration. It outlines the integration test approach used in our staging environment, where the gRPC interceptor property `maxReceiveMessageSize: 1048576` is validated against a JSON Schema patch in telemetry-config-schema.json. Readers are directed to the Vault integration guide at SecurityTests/docs/VaultIntegration.md for detailed instructions on setting up the Vault KV engine and configuring access policies. The document concludes by suggesting a series of code review checkpoints—focused on indentation, naming conventions, schema validations, and secure defaults—that align with the newly added checklist section in the Configuration File Best Practices Confluence page. By following these recommendations, engineering teams can ensure that configuration artifacts remain both consistent and secure throughout the CI/CD lifecycle.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T17:05:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z","FileId":"7b7b5f96-e9c4-485d-8588-85d144fd8784","FileLocation":"files\\Config_CI_Deep_Dive_Workshop_Plan.docx","FileName":"Config_CI_Deep_Dive_Workshop_Plan.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_tisaodon","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_jasonadon","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_eramanteca","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/DevOps/Workshops","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Configuration Standards and CI/CD Integration Deep Dive Workshop PlanTable of Contents1.

Workshop ObjectivesThe primary objectives of the session are to: • Solidify safe defaults enforcement by extending the telemetry-config schema to include default values for key properties. • Demonstrate how to author and test patternProperties for vaultReference URIs to prevent misconfiguration. • Walk through the Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy pipeline snippet, focusing on parallel fixture tests, verbose error reporting, and Slack notification integration. • Provide guided exercises that replicate real-world scenarios, including pushing sample YML snippets with both valid and invalid vault URIs. • Establish a clear post-workshop action plan, assigning ownership for rolling out changes across additional repositories and service teams.3. Agenda OverviewThe workshop will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM PST on 2025-07-27 in Teams Meeting format. High-level agenda: • 2:00 – 2:15 PM: Opening remarks and recapitulation of prior sessions. • 2:15 – 3:00 PM: Secure Defaults deep dive: Vault KV patterns and kebab-case conventions. • 3:00 – 3:45 PM: JSON Schema patternProperties: advanced use cases and edge conditions. • 3:45 – 4:00 PM: Break. • 4:00 – 4:45 PM: Hands-on lab: AJV validate and test commands in CI pipeline with fixtures. • 4:45 – 5:00 PM: Wrap-up, Q&A, and assignment of follow-up tasks.4. Detailed Session Breakdown4.1 Secure Defaults & Vault Reference PatternsWe will begin by revisiting the Vault secret reference patterns introduced in PR #127 and #130, examining the regex ^vault://secret/data/[\\\\w/]+#[\\\\w-]+$ and its placement under the vaultReference node. Attendees will modify example auth-config snippets to practice enforcing version:2 defaults and validate them against the schema using ajv validate --strict. We will discuss the implications of object merging in patternProperties and how to scope regex tests to specific nodes, ensuring that unintentional mutations do not compromise security agreements.4.2 JSON Schema Enhancements & PatternPropertiesThis section delves into the modifications in configs/schema/telemetry-config-schema.json. We will walk through the insertion of default: 1048576 for maxReceiveMessageSize and the addition of a patternProperties block. Using the Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy parallel stage, participants will observe how invalid URIs are flagged and how fixture tests under configs/schema/fixtures provide coverage for both positive and negative cases. We will analyze sample fixture error logs to identify full data paths in verbose AJV output and refine the schema accordingly, strengthening maintainability and reducing ambiguous validation failures.4.3 AJV Pipeline Integration & Fixture TestsBuilding on section 4.2, the focus shifts to integrating AJV into a CI/CD pipeline. We will examine the complete pipeline DSL and execute a live run of the schema validation stage, demonstrating the --errors-distinct and --verbose flags. Attendees will create a minimal Jenkinsfile snippet, commit to a feature branch, and observe real-time notifications in #devops-alerts. Emphasis will be placed on reducing validation time through parallel stages, optimizing test fixture design, and leveraging Slack notifications for immediate feedback.5. Pre-Workshop Preparation and Required ArtifactsParticipants should complete the following prerequisites before the workshop begins: • Clone the telemetry-config and ci-config repositories and switch to the schema-validation branch. • Review the Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx (FileId: 9d6fb2b4-be42-4061-8b5f-3df08c2b6766) and Config_Change_Log.xlsx (FileId: 106554d5-ad9b-4972-863e-ad73a5fbd6fd). • Ensure a working Jenkins environment with the AJV CLI installed and Slack integration configured. • Validate access to configs/schema/fixtures for the JSON test suite, including valid-vaultReference.json and invalid-vaultReference.json.6. Post-Workshop Deliverables and Follow-Up ActionsAfter the session, attendees are expected to: • Merge approved schema patches into the main branch and bump the telemetry-config version. • Update the Confluence “Configuration File Best Practices” page with code examples and CI pipeline snippets. • Assign follow-up tasks in Jira: AI-132 for patternProperties review, AI-133 for Vault integration enhancements, and AI-134 for cross-service rollout. • Monitor the #devops-alerts channel for validation results and CI feedback on additional repositories.Appendix A: Reference Materials • Secure Defaults and Vault Integration Guide: https://liveoak.sharepoint.com/sites/devops/Shared%20Documents/DevOps/Guides/Secure_Defaults_and_Vault_Guide.docx • Schema Validation Pipeline DSL: Jenkinsfile_AJV_Stage_v2.groovy (FileId: 568a72db-7e31-46f8-957d-b41ccb9caa4e) • Infographic: Indentation_Impact.png (FileId: 6a0afa1b-4910-4672-ad27-43740439d35b) • Deep Dive Slides: Config_Schema_DeepDive_Slides.pptx (FileId: 09990c7a-8ef8-48e1-9c53-dc6a215b0784)","TimeStamp":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"742 Redwood Crossing"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Solutions Architecture","DisplayName":"Jason Adon","FirstName":"Jason","JobTitle":"Solutions Architect","LastName":"Adon","MailNickName":"lod_jasonadon","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3172","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"147 Redwood Court"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Bev Mcginty","FirstName":"Bev","JobTitle":"QA Engineer","LastName":"Mcginty","MailNickName":"lod_bevmcg","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3345","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"987 Willow Brook Path"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Era Manteca","FirstName":"Era","JobTitle":"Software Engineer","LastName":"Manteca","MailNickName":"lod_eramanteca","Manager":"lod_shakiag","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2822","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Cypress Court"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Sau Alquesta","FirstName":"Sau","JobTitle":"Platform Technical Lead","LastName":"Alquesta","MailNickName":"lod_saulq","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3012","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"987 Silver Oak Circle"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Solutions Architecture","DisplayName":"Terina Hafen","FirstName":"Terina","JobTitle":"Solutions Architect","LastName":"Hafen","MailNickName":"lod_terinahafen","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2765","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Sierra Pine Rd"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Tisa Odonoghue","FirstName":"Tisa","JobTitle":"DevOps Engineer","LastName":"Odonoghue","MailNickName":"lod_tisaodon","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3287","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

Executive Summary..................................1\\n2. Workshop Objectives and Scope.....................2\\n3. Technical Architecture and Service Boundaries....3\\n4. Contract Test Strategy and CI/CD Integration.....4\\n5. Phased Implementation Roadmap and Next Steps....5\\n\\n1. Executive Summary\\nThis planning document captures the detailed outcomes and action items from the User Profile and Notification Pipelines workshop conducted on May 20, 2025. The half day session brought together product management, front end, back end, DevOps, and solutions architecture teams to define the user profile APIs, error handling conventions, JWT verification flow, Kafka topic topology, and end to end contract testing approach. The agreed technical requirements, architecture diagrams, and contract definitions form the foundation for an iterative development and rollout plan aimed at enhancing system reliability and backward compatibility.\\n\\n2. Workshop Objectives and Scope\\nThe primary objectives of the workshop were to align on API surface specifications, define error response models, and establish a comprehensive contract test framework. Specific goals included verifying field validation rules for the GET profile endpoint, standardizing the details array schema, annotating the JWT verification path in the API gateway, and mapping Kafka topics for change feed capture. In addition, the workshop scoped out the CI/CD pipeline enhancements required to publish and verify Pact contracts, integrate spring cloud contract stub runners, and automate compatibility checks via Jenkins. The session concluded with ownership assignments and confirmation of deliverables timelines.\\n\\n3. Technical Architecture and Service Boundaries\\nThe architecture consists of four core microservices - user service, profile service, auth service, and notification service - connected via an API gateway and event broker. Figure 1 illustrates the service topology with data flow paths and JWT verification annotations. The gateway enforces token validation and injects user metadata headers before routing. Profile service stores user data in Postgres and emits change events to the user_updates Kafka topic. Notification service consumes notification_events and handles downstream push and email distribution. Each service will include Brave instrumentation for distributed tracing and will publish span data to Elasticsearch.\\n\\n4. Contract Test Strategy and CI/CD Integration\\nA robust contract testing framework is defined using Pact JVM and spring cloud contract. Initial provider contracts cover the GET and POST profile endpoints with validation rules for errorCode and details properties. Jenkins pipeline stages will execute pactVerify against a private Pact Broker, with credentials secured via Jenkins Credentials Binding and Vault integration. The pactPublish step will propagate updated contracts and trigger compatibility checks for both v1 and v2 JSON schema definitions. The CI stage will also include Ajv schema validations for example payloads and header assertions for X-Correlation-ID to enforce trace propagation.\\n\\n5. Phased Implementation Roadmap and Next Steps\\nPhase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Finalize JSON schema drafts, merge contract schema v1.0, and implement GET endpoint changes. Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Extend pagination enhancements for v2, integrate POST endpoint contract tests, and update Jenkins shared library. Phase 3 (Week 5): Conduct end to end smoke tests in staging, validate Kafka bootstrap scripts, and prepare release v1.0. Key dependencies include UX wireframe sign off, performance benchmarks for gateway JWT performance, and coordination with DevOps for topic provisioning.

The document traces the root cause analysis that revealed fallback code paths invoking file reads on public key lookups when the in-memory cache missed, and outlines architectural improvements to preload keys in a fixed-capacity, thread-safe cache at service startup. By shifting key lookup from disk to memory, the service no longer experiences the latency spikes that previously drove 15 percent of requests to exceed the 200 millisecond threshold.The caching strategy employs a least-recently-used eviction policy with a capacity of 256 entries. Upon initializing the authentication microservice, all active public keys are loaded from the file system into an in-memory cache. The cache implementation leverages lock-free concurrent data structures to support high throughput under multithreaded workloads. During runtime, any lookup for a cached key is resolved in constant time without blocking disk operations. The cache also supports forced eviction and expiration testing by exposing management endpoints that clear entries to simulate rare cold-start scenarios without impacting production stability.To ensure long-term performance guarantees, the cache design is integrated with the continuous integration pipeline. Microbenchmark tests in auth_service/tests/test_jwt_cache_perf.py execute 1,000 consecutive signature verifications under warm and cold cache states, measuring average latencies of 1.2 milliseconds (σ = 0.3 ms) and 4.5 milliseconds (σ = 0.7 ms) respectively. The pipeline fails if the average warm-cache execution exceeds 3 ms, and a Prometheus alert on the 95th percentile response time for jwt_validation_latency has been configured to warn if latency breaches 0.003 seconds for more than two minutes. Early staging validations confirm that this proactive approach catches regressions before they reach production.Looking ahead, this document recommends extending the current design to support dynamic cache resizing based on real-time load metrics and implementing health probes that report cache hit rates as part of service telemetry. Efforts to automate cache pre-warm sequences during rolling restarts and to enrich dashboard visualizations with percentile distributions will further strengthen the authentication service’s resilience. By embedding performance validations into both the development workflow and operational monitoring, LiveOak Digital can maintain sub-200 millisecond latency as a steadfast SLA commitment.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-27T10:05:00Z","FileId":"54069e53-00ec-41d2-a7af-0be49128821f","FileLocation":"files\\DynamicCacheResizing_Metrics_DeepDive.pdf","FileName":"DynamicCacheResizing_Metrics_DeepDive.pdf","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-27T10:05:00Z","Owner":"lod_eramanteca","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_emorys","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_markitas","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_rufinag","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"docs/presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Title Page: Dynamic Cache Resizing and Metrics Deep DiveDate: July 27, 2025Presenter: Era MantecaSection 1: Introduction and Objectives- Objective: Provide a detailed, image-rich walkthrough of dynamic TTL adjustment and metrics automation for the Auth-Service LRU cache- Agenda diagram (Image: Agenda_DynamicCache.png)Section 2: Architecture OverviewCaption: LRU Cache Integration in Auth-ServiceImage: Cache_Resizing_Architecture.png shows how the GET /cache/config endpoint, Alertmanager webhook, and in-memory cache interact within the microservice and metrics pipelineSection 3: Metrics Instrumentation WorkflowImage: Metrics_Ingestion_Flow.png illustrating:  a) JMH harness pushes JSONOutputFormat metrics to Prometheus Pushgateway with labels {\"cache_ttl\",\"warm_vs_cold\"}  b) Prometheus scrapes metrics via Pushgateway exporter  c) Recording rules compute fallback misses ratio and expose histograms  d) Grafana dashboard ingests metrics for real-time visualizationSection 4: Config Endpoint API SchemaInclude JSON schema snippet for GET /cache/config response:{  \"type\":\"object\",  \"properties\":{    \"ttlSeconds\":{\"type\":\"integer\",\"minimum\":30,\"maximum\":300},    \"capacity\":{\"type\":\"integer\",\"minimum\":1},    \"fallbackHistory\":{\"type\":\"array\",\"items\":{\"type\":\"number\"},\"minItems\":1,\"maxItems\":10}  },  \"required\":[\"ttlSeconds\",\"capacity\",\"fallbackHistory\"]}Image: Config_Endpoint_Schema_Diagram.png visualizing schemaSection 5: Alert & Automation FlowchartImage: Alert_Automation_Flowchart.png displays Alertmanager rule auth_service_perf:fallback_misses_total >0.05 triggers webhook POST /cache/config?action=adjust&targetTtl=<value> within 1m windowSection 6: JMH Harness ExtensionImage: JMH_TTL_Parameterization.png shows @Param annotation in AuthServicePerf.java with values {\"30\",\"60\",\"120\",\"300\",\"adaptive\"} and custom extension to vary TTL mid-benchmarkSection 7: Example Data VisualizationsScreenshot: Grafana_Dynamic_TTL_Plot.png depicting P95 latency over TTL variantsScreenshot: Prometheus_Histogram.png of fallback_misses_total histogramSection 8: Next Steps & Action Items- Automate Alertmanager webhook in staging via CI pipeline- Update dynamic-resize-service to support histogram pushback- Schedule follow-up validation session on July 28 at 14:00 UTCAppendix: Diagram file references and code snippets are indexed in docs/design/cache_resizing_images.zip","TimeStamp":"2025-07-27T10:05:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-24T12:15:00Z","FileId":"7214cbee-bfdb-457b-8576-b7ef96d521d4","FileLocation":"files\\JWT_Cache_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","FileName":"JWT_Cache_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-24T12:15:00Z","Owner":"lod_nilatanguma","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_tonycool","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_porshab","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Deep Dive into JWT Cache PerformanceParagraph: This slide summarizes microbenchmark and production metrics for the JWT LRU cache.

We examine the end-to-end instrumentation latency constraints, logging granularity, and data schema evolution in microservices environments. Using practical measurements from our Java-based telemetry client and Logstash pipeline, we evaluate performance overhead and reliability trade-offs. Our work aligns with best practices in structured logging [1], cloud-native telemetry frameworks [4], and large-scale event data management [2].Page 21. IntroductionThe rapid adoption of microservices necessitates robust telemetry to ensure observability and operational resilience. On July 23, 2025, we held a collaborative design session involving product management, UX/UI design, and key engineering stakeholders at LiveOak Digital. We defined core requirements: maximum 500 ms instrumentation latency, error-level granularity at WARN/DEBUG, and JSON payloads containing timestamp, module, operation, userId, and requestId. This session informs our current research and design strategy.2. Background and Related WorkObservability frameworks emphasize structured logging, metrics, and tracing [1]. Barroso and Hölzle [2] discuss the importance of event-based logging in large-scale datacenters. Smith et al. [3] provide patterns for JSON schema evolution in logging. These works guide our schema definitions and pipeline architecture.Page 33. Telemetry Client ImplementationWe implement a custom telemetry client library in Java, extending Log4j2’s JSONLayout. We enrich each record with traceId and spanId at WARN or higher levels and route entries to Kafka. The client uses asynchronous appenders to maintain sub-1 ms average call latency measured via a microbenchmark harness (50 threads, 10k iterations). We record P95 call latency below 1 ms, consistent with previous studies on non-blocking appenders [3].3.1 Schema DesignOur JSON schema includes fields: timestamp (ISO 8601), module (string), operation (string), userId (UUID), requestId (UUID), level (string), and optional metadata. We version the schema under the Confluence contract and employ the everit-org JSON Schema validator to enforce backward compatibility.Page 44. Data Ingestion PipelineThe Logstash pipeline reads logs via Filebeat from app.log with multiline JSON support. We apply grok patterns to extract timestamp and thread, then index into Elasticsearch under dev-telemetry-* indices. Our performance benchmark shows ingestion P95 latency of 450 ms end-to-end, well within the 500 ms SLA.4.1 Optimization StrategiesWe leverage index templates with explicit mappings to reduce shard overhead [2]. We parallelize Logstash filter workers to match CPU core counts and disable dynamic mapping during peak load to avoid runtime overhead.4.2 Grafana DashboardsWe build Grafana dashboards with the Elastic datasource plugin, monitoring ingestion latency percentiles and error rates by endpoint. A second panel uses Prometheus to count dropped messages and serialization failures via client metrics endpoints.Page 55. Testing and ValidationWe develop exhaustive JUnit suites covering serialization of loginAttempt, dataFetch, and paymentSubmit event types. We simulate downstream Kafka failures using Mockito mocks, verifying exception handling without blocking the main thread. The microbenchmark harness ensures average append call below 1 ms.5.1 Continuous IntegrationIn our CI pipeline, we archive test coverage reports and fail builds if coverage drops below 90%. We integrate schema validation as a Post-Test-Gates job to detect contract violations early.Page 66. DiscussionThe combination of structured logging and asynchronous transmission provides low-latency telemetry with high reliability. We observe a trade-off between batch size and throughput: larger batches reduce network overhead but increase end-to-end latency. We plan to explore adaptive batching strategies as future work.6.1 Future DirectionsIntegration with OpenTelemetry [4] SDKs and adoption of OTLP may streamline cross-language telemetry. Additionally, exploring gRPC-based log transmission could further reduce latency.Page 77. ConclusionOur case study demonstrates that a well-designed telemetry architecture can meet strict latency and granularity requirements in microservices. We provide a reference implementation and performance benchmarks that can guide similar efforts in other organizations.References[1] T.

Following the cross-functional design session held on July 23, 2025, we established consistent naming conventions for critical fields including timestamp, module, operation, requestId, and traceId, and simplified the schema by flattening nested metadata attributes to the top level. This decision was driven by the need to reduce complexity in our Logstash grok filters and improve maintainability across multiple services. The environment attribute, defined as an enumeration of dev, staging, and prod, ensures that logs are correctly tagged at ingestion time, enabling precise filtering in Kibana and Grafana dashboards. All schema changes are documented on our Confluence page and version controlled under the everit-org JSON Schema validator contract to guarantee backward compatibility and automated validation in our CI pipeline.On the ingestion side, we configure Filebeat to monitor the application log file with multiline JSON support, ensuring each event is captured as a single JSON object. The Logstash pipeline applies custom grok patterns to extract the timestamp and thread fields before using the mutate filter to add the environment tag based on metadata. The snippet under /ops/logging/logstash/telemetry.conf reads as follows: filter { if [fileset][module] == \"app\" { mutate { add_field => { \"environment\" => \"%{[@metadata][env]}\" } } } } I validate this configuration against a local Elasticsearch node by replaying sample event streams and verifying that the dev-telemetry-* index receives records with the correct mappings. Index templates enforce explicit field types to optimize shard allocation and support efficient range queries on instrumentation latency metrics. Performance tests demonstrate that our end-to-end ingestion P95 latency remains below 450 ms, comfortably within our 500 ms SLA.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T17:45:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-27T09:00:00Z","FileId":"b74f0dba-7a44-4759-b404-ba8520ebde1e","FileLocation":"files\\Telemetry_Performance_Deep_Dive.pptx","FileName":"Telemetry_Performance_Deep_Dive.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-27T09:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_mylesm","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_oziller","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_ashleyengel","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_rufinag","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide Deck: Telemetry Performance Deep Dive: Key Outcomes and Next StepsPresenter: Shakia Gencarelli | July 27, 2025, 09:00 AM PDTSlide 1: Title• Telemetry Performance Deep Dive: Key Outcomes and Next Steps• LiveOak Digital DevOps Research TeamSlide 2: Agenda1.

We aligned on JSON payload structure, defining mandatory fields for timestamp, module, operation, userId, requestId, and the newly introduced \"environment\" tag. The session was documented in Confluence and formalized under the everit-org JSON Schema contract to ensure backward compatibility across versions.We enhanced the custom telemetry client by extending Log4j2’s JSONLayout to automatically enrich each record with traceId and spanId when error or higher levels occur. A non-blocking Kafka appender was implemented to route WARN and ERROR events to our centralized topic, preserving sub-1 ms per-call latency as measured by our JMH microbenchmark harness (50 threads, 10k iterations). All code changes have accompanying JUnit tests to validate schema conformance and exception resilience under simulated Kafka failures.On the ingestion side, Filebeat is configured for multiline JSON support on the application log, feeding into a Logstash pipeline with optimized grok filters for timestamp and thread extraction. We leveraged the mutate filter to inject the environment field based on Filebeat metadata.env, reducing downstream parsing complexity. Index templates for dev-telemetry-* enforce explicit field mappings to minimize shard overhead and guarantee efficient range queries for instrumentation latency metrics.Our Grafana dashboards now combine Elastic indices and Prometheus counters to surface end-to-end P95 ingestion latency, error rates by endpoint, and custom metrics for dropped messages and serialization failures. The CI pipeline archives test coverage reports and enforces a 90 % threshold, with schema validation integrated as a Post-Test-Gates job. Next steps include stress testing at production‐scale (20 k eps), exploring OpenTelemetry OTLP export, and quarterly telemetry performance reviews with key stakeholders.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T18:30:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"123 LiveOak Way"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Shakia Gencarelli","FirstName":"Shakia","JobTitle":"Senior Software Engineer","LastName":"Gencarelli","MailNickName":"lod_shakiag","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2749","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"789 Oak Ridge Blvd"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Nila Tanguma","FirstName":"Nila","JobTitle":"Engineering Manager","LastName":"Tanguma","MailNickName":"lod_nilatanguma","Manager":"lod_saturninasoyke","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 1654","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Pine Creek Lane"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Wilford Taussig","FirstName":"Wilford","JobTitle":"DevOps Engineer","LastName":"Taussig","MailNickName":"lod_wilfordt","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3123","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"987 Elm Street"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Ossie Ziller","FirstName":"Ossie","JobTitle":"Release Manager","LastName":"Ziller","MailNickName":"lod_oziller","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2777","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"654 Maplewood Drive"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Miss Bjorkman","FirstName":"Miss","JobTitle":"Frontend Technical Lead","LastName":"Bjorkman","MailNickName":"lod_missbj","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2890","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"456 Redwood Avenue"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering Leadership","DisplayName":"Saturnina Soyke","FirstName":"Saturnina","JobTitle":"Director of Platform Engineering","LastName":"Soyke","MailNickName":"lod_saturninasoyke","Manager":null,"OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 4321","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

Executive SummaryThis document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance our SDK Delivery Pipeline by integrating dynamic vulnerability thresholding based on CVSS v3.1 scores. Building on the recent SDK Delivery Pipeline Deep Dive held on July 24, 2025, we propose to evolve the existing medium-severity gate to support service-specific policies and manual override flags. The plan details new components, integration points with NVD, updates to Jenkins shared libraries, and modifications to Helm chart values. Our goal is to reduce false positives, accelerate promotions, and maintain alignment with LiveOak Digital security standards.2. Background and ContextDuring the July 23 maintenance session, we introduced a fixed MEDIUM severity threshold in the Trivy scan stage. On July 24, the deep dive workshop surfaced requirements for a more granular policy that maps each CVE to its CVSS base score and allows dynamic thresholds per service component. Current limitations include sequential NVD lookups without caching, lack of threshold overrides, and Helm chart values hardcoded to a single image tag. This plan addresses these gaps and provides a roadmap for incremental delivery.[Page 2 of 4]3. Objectives and ScopeThe primary objectives are:- Develop a CVSS v3.1 Mapping Module in the Jenkins pipeline shared library.- Integrate an NVD API client with retry, caching, and parallel lookup support.- Extend the pipeline DSL to read threshold configurations from charts/sdk-java/values.yaml.- Implement manual override flags for non-critical CVEs (CVSS <5.0).- Update Helm chart templates to consume dynamic threshold values and image tags.Out of scope:- Upstream changes to third-party libraries beyond the CI pipeline.- Non-Java SDK projects (to be addressed in subsequent phases).4. Proposed Architecture and Design4.1 CVSS v3.1 Mapping ModuleWe will introduce a new Groovy class `CvssMapper` in `pipeline-shared@1.3.0` that accepts a list of CVE identifiers and returns a map of CVE to base score. The module will leverage thread pools for parallel HTTP GET requests to the NVD restful endpoint and maintain an in-memory synchronized cache for session-level deduplication.4.2 NVD API Integration LayerThe `NvdClient` component encapsulates token-based authentication, exponential backoff on HTTP 429, and JSON parsing. It will expose methods:```groovyMap<String,Float> lookupBatch(List<String> cves)```which returns CVSS base scores. We will test this client with unit tests in `pipeline-shared/src/test/groovy/CvssMapperSpec.groovy` using mocked HTTP responses.4.3 Dynamic Threshold ConfigurationChart values in `charts/sdk-java/values.yaml` will gain a new section:```yamltrivyThresholds:  defaultMaxScore: 5.0  overrides:    inventory-service: 4.5    orders-service: 5.5```The pipeline will read these values at runtime via `withCredentials` and `readYaml` steps. Images tagged `liveoak/sdk-java:${IMAGE_TAG}` will adopt thresholds based on service context.[Page 3 of 4]5.

Risk Assessment and MitigationRisk: NVD API rate limits causing slower builds.Mitigation: Implement caching and retry/backoff. Consider local JSON snapshot fallback.Risk: Chart value misconfiguration leading to unexpected promotion.Mitigation: Add validation unit tests for `trivyThresholds` schema and default guard rails.Risk: Service-specific overrides incomplete or missing.Mitigation: Document a CSV template for threshold input and perform manual review in pull requests.[Page 4 of 4]8.

It outlines architecture diagrams, sequence flows, configuration schemas, and integration points necessary to adopt adaptive cache resizing for production readiness.Section 2: Static Cache Baseline2.1 Overview of Static LRU Cache  - Preloads 256 public keys at service startup to eliminate disk I/O on cache hits.  - Evicts least-recently-used entries when capacity is reached.  - Monitors cache hit/miss metrics via Prometheus.Figure 1: Static Cache Flow Diagram[Image: Cache_Architecture_Diagram illustrating key preload, lookup, and eviction paths]Section 3: Dynamic Resizing Extension3.1 Design Goals  - Automatically adjust cache capacity based on operational metrics.  - Prevent unexpected latency spikes due to forced eviction under load.  - Maintain memory efficiency by shrinking cache during low-load periods.3.2 Metrics and Triggers  - jwt_cache_current_size: Gauge reflecting current cache capacity.  - jwt_cache_hit_total, jwt_cache_miss_total: Counters to compute miss-rate.  - CPU utilization threshold: evaluated via service telemetry.3.3 Resize Rules  - Upsize Condition: miss_rate > 1% sustained over 5 minutes    Action: increase capacity by 50 entries, up to max 512    Cooldown: 10 minutes  - Downsize Condition: CPU > 70% and hit_rate > 99% over 5 minutes    Action: decrease capacity by 25 entries, down to min 128    Cooldown: 10 minutesFigure 2: Dynamic Resizing Sequence Diagram[Image: Sequence_Diagram illustrating metric evaluation, rule engine, and cache adjustment]Section 4: Configuration SchemaThe following YAML schema defines the dynamic resize sections in auth_service/config/cache_settings.yaml:```yamlresize:  miss_threshold: 0.01  cpu_threshold: 0.7  up_size: 50  down_size: 25  min_capacity: 128  max_capacity: 512  evaluation_window: 5m  cooldown_period: 10m```Figure 3: Configuration Screenshot[Image: Screenshot of cache_settings.yaml with highlighted parameters]Section 5: Integration and Visualization5.1 Prometheus Recording Rules  - jwt_cache_resize_events_total: Counter for resize operations  - Alert: More than 3 resize events in 10 minutes triggers a warning5.2 Grafana Panels  - Panel 1: Cache Capacity Over Time  - Panel 2: Miss Rate vs. Capacity  - Panel 3: CPU Utilization and Hit RateFigure 4: Grafana Dashboard Mockup[Image: Mockup image showing panels for capacity, miss rate, CPU, hit rate]Section 6: Sequence of Operations1. Metrics Collector polls Prometheus every 30s2. Rule Engine evaluates conditions based on sliding windows3. If trigger met and cooldown elapsed, Resizer updates capacity4. CacheManager applies new capacity and emits event5. Monitoring and alerting reflect changes in real-timeSection 7: ConclusionDynamic resizing enhances the resilience and performance of our authentication service by adapting cache capacity to traffic patterns.

As our platform responds to varying load conditions, it is critical to ensure that capacity adjustments do not introduce instability. Thrash prevention is achieved by enforcing a configurable cooldown period between resize operations and by monitoring resize events to warn when thresholds are exceeded.In a dynamic resizing model, the cache adapts its capacity in response to miss-rate and CPU utilization metrics. When the miss-rate exceeds the defined threshold over the evaluation window, the cache increases its size by the up_size parameter. Similarly, when CPU usage climbs above its threshold and the hit-rate remains high, the cache decreases in size. Without proper controls, these adjustments can oscillate rapidly, leading to cache thrashing and unpredictable performance.To mitigate this risk, the cache_settings.yaml schema includes a cooldown_period property that defines the minimum interval between successive resize actions. This period is measured from the timestamp of the last applied resize event. During this interval, further resize triggers are ignored, and any attempts to adjust the cache size increment a thrash warning counter. By capturing these events in jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, we gain visibility into how often resize requests are suppressed.The CacheResizerService in the authentication microservice implements this logic. After fetching metrics from Prometheus via the metrics client, it evaluates conditions such as:    long elapsed = now - lastResizeTime;    if (missRate > config.getMissThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize + config.getUpSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else if (cpuUtil > config.getCpuThreshold() && hitRate > config.getHitThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize - config.getDownSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else {        thrashWarningsCounter.increment();    }This approach ensures that cache size adjustments occur no more frequently than configured, and that any suppressed triggers are accounted for. The updateCapacity method performs boundary checks against minCapacity and maxCapacity before applying changes.On the monitoring side, we introduce a Prometheus recording rule that accumulates jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, and a Grafana panel that overlays the warning counter with jwt_cache_current_size. This correlation allows engineers to quickly identify periods where the cache reached its cooldown limit. An alert can be configured to fire when thrash warnings increment multiple times within a short timeframe, indicating that operational thresholds may need tuning.Finally, we integrate thrash regression tests into our CI pipeline. The test suite simulates continuous miss-rate spikes and verifies that no more than one resize event occurs per cooldown period. This is achieved by injecting mock metrics and advancing the internal clock within the CacheResizerService. Any deviation from expected behavior fails the build, providing immediate feedback.In production, runbook procedures include instructions to inspect the thrash warning metrics and to adjust cooldown settings if necessary. By combining configuration controls, robust implementation, and comprehensive monitoring, we ensure that dynamic resizing enhances cache efficiency without sacrificing system stability.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-29T08:30:00Z"},{"type":"Chat","ChatId":"22f2285f-36b8-4214-a672-c4b73624592a","ChatType":"OneOnOne","Members":["lod_shakiag","lod_danillec"],"ChatMessages":[{"ChatMessageId":"9c3a9747-88cc-4552-a085-2c2da094e282","From":"lod_shakiag","ContentType":"text","Content":"Danille, I’ve pushed the finalized `CvssMapper` Groovy class to our shared library (pipeline-shared@1.3.1).

The document traces the root cause analysis that revealed fallback code paths invoking file reads on public key lookups when the in-memory cache missed, and outlines architectural improvements to preload keys in a fixed-capacity, thread-safe cache at service startup. By shifting key lookup from disk to memory, the service no longer experiences the latency spikes that previously drove 15 percent of requests to exceed the 200 millisecond threshold.The caching strategy employs a least-recently-used eviction policy with a capacity of 256 entries. Upon initializing the authentication microservice, all active public keys are loaded from the file system into an in-memory cache. The cache implementation leverages lock-free concurrent data structures to support high throughput under multithreaded workloads. During runtime, any lookup for a cached key is resolved in constant time without blocking disk operations. The cache also supports forced eviction and expiration testing by exposing management endpoints that clear entries to simulate rare cold-start scenarios without impacting production stability.To ensure long-term performance guarantees, the cache design is integrated with the continuous integration pipeline. Microbenchmark tests in auth_service/tests/test_jwt_cache_perf.py execute 1,000 consecutive signature verifications under warm and cold cache states, measuring average latencies of 1.2 milliseconds (σ = 0.3 ms) and 4.5 milliseconds (σ = 0.7 ms) respectively. The pipeline fails if the average warm-cache execution exceeds 3 ms, and a Prometheus alert on the 95th percentile response time for jwt_validation_latency has been configured to warn if latency breaches 0.003 seconds for more than two minutes. Early staging validations confirm that this proactive approach catches regressions before they reach production.Looking ahead, this document recommends extending the current design to support dynamic cache resizing based on real-time load metrics and implementing health probes that report cache hit rates as part of service telemetry. Efforts to automate cache pre-warm sequences during rolling restarts and to enrich dashboard visualizations with percentile distributions will further strengthen the authentication service’s resilience. By embedding performance validations into both the development workflow and operational monitoring, LiveOak Digital can maintain sub-200 millisecond latency as a steadfast SLA commitment.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-25T10:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-24T12:15:00Z","FileId":"7214cbee-bfdb-457b-8576-b7ef96d521d4","FileLocation":"files\\JWT_Cache_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","FileName":"JWT_Cache_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-24T12:15:00Z","Owner":"lod_nilatanguma","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_shakiag","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_bevmcg","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_tonycool","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_porshab","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"Shared Documents/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Deep Dive into JWT Cache PerformanceParagraph: This slide summarizes microbenchmark and production metrics for the JWT LRU cache.

The workshop aimed to standardize vulnerability scanning across CI/CD pipelines. We explore the methodologies, tool evaluation metrics, stakeholder roles, and operational SLOs defined during the session.Keywords: CI/CD, vulnerability scanning, DevSecOps, SLO, pipeline integration.1. IntroductionVulnerability scanning in modern DevOps environments is essential for early detection of security flaws [1]. Integrating scanning tools directly into CI/CD pipelines reduces feedback loops and ensures consistent policy enforcement. However, a lack of standardized approaches leads to coverage gaps and performance overhead [2].2. Related WorkPrevious studies have evaluated security automation frameworks [3], while container scanning tools have been compared in controlled settings [4]. The workshop discussed herein builds on these foundations by addressing cross-functional collaboration and real-time requirements elicitation.3. Workshop Context and MethodologyOn July 16, 2025, a three-hour workshop was conducted with participants from Engineering, Product Management, and UX/UI Design (Event ID d90f6c1d-ac87-4d87-87ba-98105737c7a5). Facilitated by Shakia Gencarelli, the agenda included defining business and security objectives, mapping stakeholder responsibilities, and drafting UI acceptance criteria. Data was collected via live Confluence updates (EngineeringDocuments/Plans/Vulnerability_Scan_Ingestion_Requirements.md).3.1 Stakeholders and RolesKey contributors: Shakia Gencarelli (CI integration owner), Era Manteca (tool evaluation), Wilford Taussig (DevOps automation), Lura Gerdts (UX/UI reporting), Ossie Ziller (release gating).4. Standardization FrameworkParticipants agreed on a framework comprising artifact coverage scopes, failure thresholds (false positives <2%), API rate-limit handling (Clair: 60 req/min, Snyk: 100 req/min), and performance SLOs (P95 latency ≤60s, build time increase ≤5%). This aligns with OWASP DevSecOps guidelines [5].5. CI/CD Pipeline Integration PatternsWe recommend a modular Jenkins shared library with method signatures: scanWithSnyk(projectDir, thresholds), scanWithClair(imageReference), publishVulnerabilityMetrics(jobName). A yaml.safe_load validation step was introduced to enforce schema correctness pre-submission.6. Tool Evaluation MetricsA comparative matrix ranked tools on vulnerability coverage, scan speed, integration complexity, and license cost. Snyk excelled in IaC scanning, while Clair provided robust container drift analysis. Trivy was included for Kubernetes YAML support. Metrics were normalized using a weighted scoring algorithm [6].7. Operational Metrics and SLOsTo monitor pipeline efficacy, key metrics include: vulnerability_count_by_severity, scan_error_rate, scan_latency_histogram. Grafana panels were defined to alert on thresholds: sustained P95 >60s, false positive rate >5%. These metrics are captured via publishVulnerabilityMetrics in the shared library.8. DiscussionThe collaborative approach ensured rapid consensus and traceability. Real-time Confluence updates foster transparency, but introduced context-switching overhead. Future sessions may incorporate asynchronous pre-work to optimize time.9. Conclusion and Future DirectionsStandardizing vulnerability scanning across CI/CD pipelines is achievable through defined frameworks, tool metrics, and shared libraries. Further research will evaluate the long-term impact on security posture and developer productivity.References[1] Martinez, A., et al., \"Continuous Security in DevOps\", Journal of Secure Software Engineering, 2023.[2] Smith, B., Johnson, C., \"Comparative Analysis of Container Scanners\", Proc.

Workshop Objectives and ScopeThe purpose of the July 25 Microservices Integration Workshop is to validate the end-to-end deployment patterns for the auth-service, payment-gateway, and fraud-detection components in our staging environment. Building on the security remediation findings from the July 22 hands-on session led by Shakia G., this workshop will confirm RS256 enforcement on JWT tokens (AI-023), tighten CORS policies (AI-024), and exercise the Consul-based service discovery for circuit-breaker configuration. Attendees will also collaborate on finalizing the HMAC-SHA256 webhook implementation and aligning the OpenAPI spec with actual service responses.2. Detailed Agenda and Session Flow2.1 Morning Integration ReviewWe begin at 09:00 with a review of the Security_Backlog_Updates.json and the Microservices_Security_Action_Tracker.xlsx. Era Manteca will present the status of AI-023 and AI-024 backlog items, including acceptance criteria and test results. Wilford Taussig will demo the latest Swagger UI changes and show live tests against the updated /auth/login and /api/v1/payments endpoints.2.2 Technical Deep Dive: OAuth2 and JWT ValidationAt 10:30, Shari Jatho will lead a discussion on the JWT validation architecture, highlighting the Vault AppRole pattern for key retrieval. A code walkthrough of the RS256-only enforcement module will be followed by a live Postman run to generate and validate signed tokens. Participants will execute HS256 fallback tests to confirm zero acceptance of weak signatures.2.3 Midday Service Registry and Circuit BreakersFollowing lunch at 12:00, Cortez Dehn will facilitate a workshop on Consul service registration and metadata propagation. We will tune circuit-breaker thresholds in the Payment-Gateway service and simulate failure scenarios to observe half-open and closed states. The YAML config snippet and Prometheus metrics for failureThreshold and successThreshold will be reviewed.2.4 Afternoon Fraud API Webhook WorkshopStarting at 14:00, Ashley Engel will guide a hands-on session on canonicalizing JSON payloads and computing HMAC-SHA256 signatures. Participants will work through the Jest unit tests in test/webhook/validateSignature.spec.ts and run Cypress e2e mocks against the staging webhook endpoint. The goal is to achieve 98% test coverage and confirm timingSafeEqual comparisons under load.3. Action Item Tracking and OwnershipThis section lists all open action items with owners, due dates, and status. We will review AI-023 through AI-026, assign any new tasks, and schedule follow-up days for each workstream. A shared Kanban board link and our Confluence page URL will be provided for ongoing tracking.4. Pre-Read Materials and ReferencesAttendees should review the following documents prior to the workshop:• Security_Backlog_Updates.json (ID: bbc0ddcb-1a99-4162-b4da-d3d1d57340cd)• Microservices_Security_Action_Tracker.xlsx (ID: dd1244fe-bf03-41ce-8fe9-130b11800129)• AuthService_Validation_Report.json (ID: d305139f-6051-48f0-a764-e57bd0e40798)• Microservices_Integration_DeepDive.pptx (ID: 4bc236de-d6dc-41fc-9a70-2639158fdff5)5.

Appendix: Reference Materials........................................71. IntroductionThis document provides a comprehensive plan for the upcoming Microservices Integration & Security Remediation Workshop scheduled for July 25, 2025. Following Shakia G.'s hands-on integration session on July 22, our goals are to address identified security vulnerabilities and finalize end-to-end service workflows.2. Workshop Agenda & ObjectivesThe workshop will begin with a review of AI-023 and AI-024 backlog items, covering JWT validation fallback issues and CORS misconfigurations. Next, we will validate the updated Postman collection against the staging environment, confirm OpenAPI spec alignment, and ensure Swagger UI synchronization. The afternoon session focuses on Consul service registry integration, circuit-breaker configuration, and third-party fraud API webhook handling. Key objectives include:- Verifying RS256 enforcement in auth-service and ensuring no HS256 fallback acceptance.- Testing CORS whitelist origins for /api/v1/payments and confirming Access-Control-Max-Age settings.- Reviewing Consul metadata propagation and tuning circuit-breaker thresholds.- Demonstrating HMAC-SHA256 signature validation for webhook callbacks.3. Security Remediation PlanOur remediation plan outlines detailed steps for high-severity and medium-risk issues. For AI-023, we will enforce strict RS256-only validation, update the OpenAPI spec, and incorporate additional unit tests in the Jenkins pipeline. For AI-024, we will refine the CORS policy by restricting origins to example.com and api.example.com, adjust preflight cache TTL to 600 seconds, and expand Prometheus counters for 401/403 errors. The security assessment tracker (Microservices_Security_Action_Tracker.xlsx) and detailed JSON report (AuthService_Validation_Report.json) will guide our testing scripts and CI stages.4. Integration Timeline & ResponsibilitiesWe have defined a three-day timeline:Day 1 (July 25): Workshop execution and validation exercises, led by Shari Jatho and Wilford Taussig.Day 2 (July 26): PR reviews and pipeline updates, owned by Era Manteca and Cortez Dehn.Day 3 (July 27): End-to-end testing of fraud API integration, led by Era Manteca and Ashley Engel.Action items are assigned with clear due dates and follow-up checkpoints. Weekly syncs will track progress until completion.5.

It builds on the high-level outline distributed in the workshop follow-up note, offering engineers a concrete reference for integrating scanning methods and schema validation into any declarative or scripted Jenkinsfile. The narrative begins by tracing the modular design decisions that led to a maintainable shared library architecture, then drills into the implementation of each core utility method and concludes with integration examples and operational considerations.At the heart of our approach lies a Groovy-based shared library that encapsulates four primary functions: scanWithSnyk, scanWithClair, publishVulnerabilityMetrics, and validatePipelineSchema. The library is organized under src/com/liveoakdevsecops with each method in its own class, accompanied by unit tests in src/test/groovy. We leverage Jenkins classpath isolation and library versioning so that teams can pin to a stable release (e.g., 1.2.0) while updates to the library are published to Artifactory. This separation ensures that incremental enhancements—such as adding new threshold parameters or supporting a secondary scanner—do not disrupt existing pipelines.The scanWithSnyk function is implemented as a thin wrapper around the Snyk CLI, accepting a workspace path and a map of thresholds for project directories. Internally, it constructs a command line string that injects P95 latency and false positive thresholds, then captures SARIF output and archives it to a build artifact folder. The scanWithClair method follows a similar structure but uses Docker to spin up a local Clair service, pipes in the container image reference, and generates JSON results which are then converted to Prometheus counters. The publishVulnerabilityMetrics method collects key metrics—vulnerability_count_by_severity, scan_error_rate, and scan_latency_histogram—from the workspace and pushes them to the Jenkins metrics plugin. The validatePipelineSchema method employs a yaml.safe_load call against our JSON Schema definitions, ensuring that any missing required stages or malformed environment blocks cause a pipeline failure with actionable error messages.To illustrate integration, consider a declarative Jenkinsfile snippet: pipeline { agent any; stages { stage('Validate Config') { steps { sharedLibrary.validatePipelineSchema('schemas/pipeline-schema.json', 'Jenkinsfile') } } stage('Scan') { environment { THRESHOLDS = credentials('scan-thresholds') } steps { sharedLibrary.scanWithSnyk(env.WORKSPACE, THRESHOLDS); sharedLibrary.scanWithClair(env.IMAGE_REF); sharedLibrary.publishVulnerabilityMetrics(env.JOB_NAME) } } } } The shared library automatically loads via the @Library annotation, and the methods handle exit codes and logging according to our team conventions. Engineers are advised to parameterize threshold values via Jenkins credentials or parameterized builds, ensuring repeatable runs across branches and environments. By following this deep dive, teams will be equipped to extend the library for new scanning tools, integrate custom Prometheus recording rules, and maintain consistency in CI/CD vulnerability enforcement across LiveOak Digital’s engineering organization.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-19T09:30:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-21T10:00:00Z","FileId":"59c55209-bbd6-4234-b518-5deea7c97dc3","FileLocation":"files\\DevSecOps_Workshop_Outcomes_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","FileName":"DevSecOps_Workshop_Outcomes_Deep_Dive_Presentation.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-21T10:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_eramanteca","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_loriaf","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_luger","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_oziller","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title: 'DevSecOps Workshop Outcomes Deep Dive'\\nPresenter: Shakia Gencarelli\\nDate: July 21, 2025\\n\\nSlide 2: Agenda\\n- Recap of workshop objectives\\n- Detailed tool evaluation metrics review\\n- CI/CD pipeline integration patterns\\n- DevSecOps automation plan deep dive\\n- Action items and timelines\\n\\nSlide 3: Workshop Objectives and Key Outcomes\\n- Standardize vulnerability scanning across CI/CD\\n- Define SLOs: P95 latency ≤60s, build time overhead ≤5%\\n- Tool matrix evaluated Snyk, Clair, Trivy: see 'Tool Evaluation Matrix' pivot chart infographic\\n- Stakeholder roles assigned: Shakia (CI owner), Era (Tool evaluation), Wilford (Automation), Lura (UX), Ossie (Release gating)\\n\\nSlide 4: Tool Evaluation Matrix Deep Analysis\\n- Infographic: Radar chart of coverage (IaC, container, K8s)\\n- Table excerpt: Snyk (top rank), Clair (secondary), Trivy (K8s YAML support)\\n- Reference: https://liveoak.sharepoint.com/sites/EngineeringDocuments/Plans/Vulnerability_Scan_Ingestion_Requirements.md#matrix\\n\\nSlide 5: CI/CD Pipeline Patterns\\n- Jenkins shared library methods: scanWithSnyk, scanWithClair, publishVulnerabilityMetrics, validatePipelineSchema\\n- Sequence diagram infographic: stage flow from config validation to metrics publication\\n- Attached: Jenkins_Shared_Library_Methods.patch (File ID: ddcec7e0-f62c-410f-bbef-2e1dd844ad33)\\n\\nSlide 6: DevSecOps Automation Plan\\n- yaml.safe_load schema validation to catch misconfigured flags\\n- CLI version constraints and environment variables for scanners\\n- Flowchart: automation pipeline steps\\n- Document: DevSecOps_Automation_Pipeline_Deep_Dive.docx (File ID: 5824edd2-cbfc-4429-adbb-542c2bcbba3a)\\n\\nSlide 7: Metrics and Monitoring Infographics\\n- Grafana panel mockup: vulnerability_count_by_severity histogram\\n- Prometheus histograms: scan_latency (p95/p99) and scan_error_rate\\n- Threshold reference: ScanMetrics_Threshold_Reference_Table.xlsx (File ID: 64b97ed3-6504-47e0-89ea-c57fe24aae51)\\n\\nSlide 8: Action Items & Next Steps\\n- Deliver wireframes by Lura Gerdts (File: a2bf6521-c4e4-457f-a2ba-f1875817a624) by July 21\\n- Prototype Snyk integration report: Era Manteca (File: 24161144-adce-48b7-beab-230d03d115b3) by July 20\\n- Merge Jenkins library PR: Shakia Gencarelli by July 19\\n- Dashboard implementation: Wilford Taussig by July 22\\n- Release gating runbook update: Ossie Ziller by July 22\\n\\nSlide 9: Links to Workshop Artifacts\\n- Standardizing Workshop Analysis: Standardizing_Vulnerability_Scanning_CI-CD_Workshop_Analysis.pdf (File ID: 71873e29-9530-45b6-b3ea-33bdf7a518a4)\\n- Detailed Requirements Document: Detailed_Workshop_Requirements.docx (File ID: 19d24a84-d069-41ec-bb3c-dd54e77b9113)\\n- Pipeline Deep Dive: DevSecOps_Automation_Pipeline_Deep_Dive.docx (File ID: 5824edd2-cbfc-4429-adbb-542c2bcbba3a)\\n- Snyk Staging Report: Snyk_Integration_Staging_Report.md (File ID: 24161144-adce-48b7-beab-230d03d115b3)\\n\\nSlide 10: Q&A and Discussion","TimeStamp":"2025-07-21T10:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-24T08:00:00Z","FileId":"10e26ca1-c5f1-428f-b2f3-a9973b257262","FileLocation":"files\\Microservices_Integration_Security_Workshop_Plan.docx","FileName":"Microservices_Integration_Security_Workshop_Plan.docx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-24T08:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_eramanteca","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_sharij","PermissionLevel":"edit"},{"Email":"lod_cortezdehn","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_markitas","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Plans","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Table of Contents1.

Appendix: Reference Materials........................................71. IntroductionThis document provides a comprehensive plan for the upcoming Microservices Integration & Security Remediation Workshop scheduled for July 25, 2025. Following Shakia G.'s hands-on integration session on July 22, our goals are to address identified security vulnerabilities and finalize end-to-end service workflows.2. Workshop Agenda & ObjectivesThe workshop will begin with a review of AI-023 and AI-024 backlog items, covering JWT validation fallback issues and CORS misconfigurations. Next, we will validate the updated Postman collection against the staging environment, confirm OpenAPI spec alignment, and ensure Swagger UI synchronization. The afternoon session focuses on Consul service registry integration, circuit-breaker configuration, and third-party fraud API webhook handling. Key objectives include:- Verifying RS256 enforcement in auth-service and ensuring no HS256 fallback acceptance.- Testing CORS whitelist origins for /api/v1/payments and confirming Access-Control-Max-Age settings.- Reviewing Consul metadata propagation and tuning circuit-breaker thresholds.- Demonstrating HMAC-SHA256 signature validation for webhook callbacks.3. Security Remediation PlanOur remediation plan outlines detailed steps for high-severity and medium-risk issues. For AI-023, we will enforce strict RS256-only validation, update the OpenAPI spec, and incorporate additional unit tests in the Jenkins pipeline. For AI-024, we will refine the CORS policy by restricting origins to example.com and api.example.com, adjust preflight cache TTL to 600 seconds, and expand Prometheus counters for 401/403 errors. The security assessment tracker (Microservices_Security_Action_Tracker.xlsx) and detailed JSON report (AuthService_Validation_Report.json) will guide our testing scripts and CI stages.4. Integration Timeline & ResponsibilitiesWe have defined a three-day timeline:Day 1 (July 25): Workshop execution and validation exercises, led by Shari Jatho and Wilford Taussig.Day 2 (July 26): PR reviews and pipeline updates, owned by Era Manteca and Cortez Dehn.Day 3 (July 27): End-to-end testing of fraud API integration, led by Era Manteca and Ashley Engel.Action items are assigned with clear due dates and follow-up checkpoints. Weekly syncs will track progress until completion.5.

It outlines the rationale behind each panel’s query expression, describes the presentation options selected to surface the most critical information, and explains how these metrics integrate with our alerting strategy for high reliability.The first section examines the Migration P95 Latency panel, where the expression histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(migration_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, env)) retrieves the 95th percentile of migration durations over a rolling five-minute window. We grouped metrics by the env label to allow side-by-side comparison between staging and production. The threshold line is set at 2 seconds, reflecting our target maximum latency. Color overrides transition from green below 1 second, to yellow between 1 and 2 seconds, and to red above 2 seconds, giving immediate visual feedback on performance trends.Next, the Rollback P95 Latency panel is described. It employs the expression histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(rollback_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, env)) and uses a 2.5-second threshold line to detect regressions in rollback speed. This higher threshold acknowledges that rollback operations may incur additional overhead. Panel configuration leverages unit display in seconds with one decimal precision, and the legend is formatted to show per-environment values in a concise format.The third section details the Rollback Success Rate gauge. Using the expression sum(migration_successful_rollbacks_total) / sum(migration_attempts_total), expressed as a percentage, this panel provides a real-time success metric for rollback operations. We established a static threshold at 98 percent, based on historical run data. The gauge’s background color shifts to red below 95 percent, alerting the team to any systemic issues that may warrant immediate investigation.Finally, the guide addresses panel layout and interaction design choices. We placed these three panels in a dedicated row labeled \"Migration and Rollback Observability,\" ensuring clarity of purpose. We configured hover tooltips to display raw bucket data for deeper analysis and set up drilldown links to our runbook and Prometheus console. These configurations provide on-call engineers quick pathways from high-level alerts to detailed dashboards and documentation.By consolidating these panels into a single, unified dashboard, we aim to reduce time to detection and mean time to resolution for migration-related incidents. This document will be maintained in our EngineeringDocuments repository, and we welcome feedback to refine thresholds and visual settings as our pipeline evolves.","TimeStamp":"2025-06-16T11:15:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-06-16T12:30:00Z","FileId":"b00556ac-e876-4a58-b48a-7af8cfd2ff14","FileLocation":"files\\Migration_Rollback_DetailedMetrics.xlsx","FileName":"Migration_Rollback_DetailedMetrics.xlsx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-06-16T12:30:00Z","Owner":"lod_shakiag","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_nilatanguma","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_wilfordt","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_ashleyengel","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_eramanteca","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_tisaodon","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_porshab","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"EngineeringDocuments/Metrics","DestinationType":"site","Content":"[Sheet:Pipeline

As our platform responds to varying load conditions, it is critical to ensure that capacity adjustments do not introduce instability. Thrash prevention is achieved by enforcing a configurable cooldown period between resize operations and by monitoring resize events to warn when thresholds are exceeded.In a dynamic resizing model, the cache adapts its capacity in response to miss-rate and CPU utilization metrics. When the miss-rate exceeds the defined threshold over the evaluation window, the cache increases its size by the up_size parameter. Similarly, when CPU usage climbs above its threshold and the hit-rate remains high, the cache decreases in size. Without proper controls, these adjustments can oscillate rapidly, leading to cache thrashing and unpredictable performance.To mitigate this risk, the cache_settings.yaml schema includes a cooldown_period property that defines the minimum interval between successive resize actions. This period is measured from the timestamp of the last applied resize event. During this interval, further resize triggers are ignored, and any attempts to adjust the cache size increment a thrash warning counter. By capturing these events in jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, we gain visibility into how often resize requests are suppressed.The CacheResizerService in the authentication microservice implements this logic. After fetching metrics from Prometheus via the metrics client, it evaluates conditions such as:    long elapsed = now - lastResizeTime;    if (missRate > config.getMissThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize + config.getUpSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else if (cpuUtil > config.getCpuThreshold() && hitRate > config.getHitThreshold() && elapsed >= config.getCooldownPeriod()) {        updateCapacity(currentSize - config.getDownSize());        lastResizeTime = now;    } else {        thrashWarningsCounter.increment();    }This approach ensures that cache size adjustments occur no more frequently than configured, and that any suppressed triggers are accounted for. The updateCapacity method performs boundary checks against minCapacity and maxCapacity before applying changes.On the monitoring side, we introduce a Prometheus recording rule that accumulates jwt_cache_thrash_warnings_total, and a Grafana panel that overlays the warning counter with jwt_cache_current_size. This correlation allows engineers to quickly identify periods where the cache reached its cooldown limit. An alert can be configured to fire when thrash warnings increment multiple times within a short timeframe, indicating that operational thresholds may need tuning.Finally, we integrate thrash regression tests into our CI pipeline. The test suite simulates continuous miss-rate spikes and verifies that no more than one resize event occurs per cooldown period. This is achieved by injecting mock metrics and advancing the internal clock within the CacheResizerService. Any deviation from expected behavior fails the build, providing immediate feedback.In production, runbook procedures include instructions to inspect the thrash warning metrics and to adjust cooldown settings if necessary. By combining configuration controls, robust implementation, and comprehensive monitoring, we ensure that dynamic resizing enhances cache efficiency without sacrificing system stability.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-29T08:30:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"321 Pine Creek Lane"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Wilford Taussig","FirstName":"Wilford","JobTitle":"DevOps Engineer","LastName":"Taussig","MailNickName":"lod_wilfordt","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 3123","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"123 LiveOak Way"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Shakia Gencarelli","FirstName":"Shakia","JobTitle":"Senior Software Engineer","LastName":"Gencarelli","MailNickName":"lod_shakiag","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2749","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

Each pipeline stage now references the corresponding RSD section: Section 5.4 for CSRF bypass header injection, Section 3.2 for auth flow end-to-end tests, and Section 4.1 for container image analysis. The Jenkinsfile defines three main stages: Dynamic Security Scan with mediumRiskThreshold=10 and highRiskThreshold=0, Token Simulation using the jest tokenRefresh fixture, and Container Hardening invoking Trivy.To support automated compliance auditing, we integrated Slack webhook alerts to #devops-security to notify of any policy breaches in real time, satisfying the audit logging requirements of Section 6.2 of the RSD. All pipeline artifacts and security reports are archived to s3://compliance/liveoak/2025-07-22/pipelines under TRACE_2025-07-22, ensuring full artifact traceability and retention for compliance review.Next steps: I am circulating this document to Terina Hafen and Shari Jatho for Solutions Architecture sign-off.

This document captures the configuration details, audit considerations, and operational flow required to maintain real-time visibility for both engineering and compliance stakeholders.The Jenkinsfile’s SlackNotifications stage is configured to post threshold breach events to the #devops-security channel. The integration uses a secure webhook stored in the Jenkins SSLVault plugin, which retrieves the Slack token at runtime. For every security scan execution, the pipeline includes the controlTag attribute set to session_integrity_control, ensuring each Slack message carries the OWASP SI-10 mapping. These messages include the build ID, branch name, and a direct link to the archived S3 folder, enabling rapid triage by both our on-call developers and the Security Governance team.In parallel, the Opsgenie integration leverages the opsgenie_integration.yaml snippet maintained in our repository. The YAML defines the ComplianceOps team, SecurityGovernance responders, and a payload object containing the eventName PipelineThresholdBreach and the session_integrity_control tag. During a policy breach, the pipeline invokes the Opsgenie API using the OPS_API_KEY credential, generating an incident that surfaces on our compliance dashboard and triggers PagerDuty escalations if unresolved within our SLA window.From an audit perspective, each pipeline run archives its artifacts under s3://compliance/liveoak/2025-07-28/pipelines, with server-side encryption enabled using AES256. The archival block in template.yaml specifies a retentionDays of 2555, aligning with our seven-year archival mandate. Additional metadata fields such as archiveRetentionDays and sessionTokenExpiry are injected into the object tags, providing clear traceability for auditors verifying FISMA and GDPR compliance.The next actionable steps involve finalizing the PR that consolidates these notification stages, merging the updates to the feature branch, and coordinating with Solutions Architecture for a formal compliance sign-off early next week. With this integration in place, our pipeline not only enforces robust security gates but also delivers transparent, auditable notifications to all relevant stakeholders.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-28T09:45:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-22T20:00:00Z","FileId":"a405ce3f-c548-4951-ba2e-c9e72cd04c2a","FileLocation":"files\\DevSecOps_Pipeline_Deep_Dive_a405ce3f-c548-4951-ba2e-c9e72cd04c2a.pptx","FileName":"DevSecOps_Pipeline_Deep_Dive_a405ce3f-c548-4951-ba2e-c9e72cd04c2a.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-22T20:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_nilatanguma","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_sharij","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_danillec","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_kerenguisbert","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_octaviaj","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_jackschrott","PermissionLevel":"view"}],"FileDestination":"s3://compliance/liveoak/2025-07-22/presentations","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title Slide - DevSecOps Pipeline Deep Dive: Code Review & Compliance Session • Presenter: Nila Tanguma (Engineering Manager) • Date: July 22, 2025Slide 2: Agenda • Requirements Specification Alignment • Code Review Workflow Highlights • DevSecOps Pipeline Architecture • Audit Artifact Management • Compliance Dashboard & Alerts • Traceability & Next StepsSlide 3: Requirements Specification Alignment • Image: Traceability Matrix mapping RSD controls to pipeline stages (Section 5.4 screenshot) • Highlights:   – API contracts & data validation rules (Section 2.1)   – OWASP Top 10 control mapping (Section 4.2)Slide 4: Code Review Workflow • Image: PR summary snapshot for PR #642 and PR #643 • Key focus areas:   – ESLint & TypeScript lint rules enforcement   – Unit tests covering invalid payloads & timeout retries   – JSDoc generation for interface documentationSlide 5: DevSecOps Pipeline Architecture • Image: Diagram of Jenkins pipeline stages • Stages:   1.

Executive SummaryThis document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance our SDK Delivery Pipeline by integrating dynamic vulnerability thresholding based on CVSS v3.1 scores. Building on the recent SDK Delivery Pipeline Deep Dive held on July 24, 2025, we propose to evolve the existing medium-severity gate to support service-specific policies and manual override flags. The plan details new components, integration points with NVD, updates to Jenkins shared libraries, and modifications to Helm chart values. Our goal is to reduce false positives, accelerate promotions, and maintain alignment with LiveOak Digital security standards.2. Background and ContextDuring the July 23 maintenance session, we introduced a fixed MEDIUM severity threshold in the Trivy scan stage. On July 24, the deep dive workshop surfaced requirements for a more granular policy that maps each CVE to its CVSS base score and allows dynamic thresholds per service component. Current limitations include sequential NVD lookups without caching, lack of threshold overrides, and Helm chart values hardcoded to a single image tag. This plan addresses these gaps and provides a roadmap for incremental delivery.[Page 2 of 4]3. Objectives and ScopeThe primary objectives are:- Develop a CVSS v3.1 Mapping Module in the Jenkins pipeline shared library.- Integrate an NVD API client with retry, caching, and parallel lookup support.- Extend the pipeline DSL to read threshold configurations from charts/sdk-java/values.yaml.- Implement manual override flags for non-critical CVEs (CVSS <5.0).- Update Helm chart templates to consume dynamic threshold values and image tags.Out of scope:- Upstream changes to third-party libraries beyond the CI pipeline.- Non-Java SDK projects (to be addressed in subsequent phases).4. Proposed Architecture and Design4.1 CVSS v3.1 Mapping ModuleWe will introduce a new Groovy class `CvssMapper` in `pipeline-shared@1.3.0` that accepts a list of CVE identifiers and returns a map of CVE to base score. The module will leverage thread pools for parallel HTTP GET requests to the NVD restful endpoint and maintain an in-memory synchronized cache for session-level deduplication.4.2 NVD API Integration LayerThe `NvdClient` component encapsulates token-based authentication, exponential backoff on HTTP 429, and JSON parsing. It will expose methods:```groovyMap<String,Float> lookupBatch(List<String> cves)```which returns CVSS base scores. We will test this client with unit tests in `pipeline-shared/src/test/groovy/CvssMapperSpec.groovy` using mocked HTTP responses.4.3 Dynamic Threshold ConfigurationChart values in `charts/sdk-java/values.yaml` will gain a new section:```yamltrivyThresholds:  defaultMaxScore: 5.0  overrides:    inventory-service: 4.5    orders-service: 5.5```The pipeline will read these values at runtime via `withCredentials` and `readYaml` steps. Images tagged `liveoak/sdk-java:${IMAGE_TAG}` will adopt thresholds based on service context.[Page 3 of 4]5.

Timeline and Milestones- Week of Jul 27: Design and prototyping of mapping module- Week of Aug 3: Integration of pipeline DSL and Helm changes- Week of Aug 10: Test execution and performance tuning- Aug 12: Release candidate merge into main pipeline branch- Aug 14: Production promotion and monitoring baseline reset7. Risk Assessment and MitigationRisk: NVD API rate limits causing slower builds.Mitigation: Implement caching and retry/backoff. Consider local JSON snapshot fallback.Risk: Chart value misconfiguration leading to unexpected promotion.Mitigation: Add validation unit tests for `trivyThresholds` schema and default guard rails.Risk: Service-specific overrides incomplete or missing.Mitigation: Document a CSV template for threshold input and perform manual review in pull requests.[Page 4 of 4]8.

1: Title: \"CVSS Mapping Workshop: Deep Dive into Jenkins Pipeline Integration\"Presenter: Shakia GencarelliDate: July 27, 2025Slide 2: Agenda- Recap of SDK Delivery Pipeline enhancements- Trivy integration architecture- CVSS v3.1 mapping rationale- Jenkins shared library design- NVD API integration details- Parallel lookup and caching strategies- Helm values dynamic thresholds- Live demo walkthrough- Performance benchmark results- Next steps & Q&ASlide 3: SDK Delivery Pipeline Enhancements RecapImage: Jenkins stage diagram illustrating the insertion of \"Build & Push SDK Image\" stage between Unit Tests and Vulnerability Scan- Introduced multi-stage Docker build for Java SDK- Added pipeline stage to build and push liveoak/sdk-java:v1.4.0-ci-20250723- Implemented initial Trivy scan gated on MEDIUM severitySlide 4: Trivy Integration ArchitectureImage: Block diagram of Trivy execution within the Jenkins pipeline- Custom DSL in pipelines/trivy-config.groovy- Artifacts archived at build/{BUILD_NUMBER}/artifacts/trivy-report.json- Fail-fast on CVE severity >= MEDIUM via error() callSlide 5: Limitations of Severity Labels- MEDIUM/HIGH labels lack precision- Similar severities can have different CVSS base scores- Need numeric score-based gating for finer controlSlide 6: CVSS v3.1 Score Mapping Rationale- Utilize NVD REST API to fetch CVSS base scores- Support per-service thresholds for flexibility- Align pipeline gating with security policy (score >=5.0 fails)Slide 7: Jenkins Shared Library: CvssMapper & NvdClientImage: UML class diagram showing CvssMapper and NvdClient interaction- CvssMapper.lookupBatch(List<String> cves) returns Map<String,Float>- NvdClient handles HTTP calls with token auth and backoff- ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel requestsSlide 8: Parallel Lookup and Caching StrategyImage: Sequence diagram of CompletableFuture tasks and cache hits- Futures supplyAsync for each CVE- ConcurrentHashMap cache to avoid duplicate lookups- Timeout of 10 seconds per lookup- Total stage duration kept under Jenkins 60s timeoutSlide 9: Helm Chart Dynamic Threshold Configuration- Added trivyThresholds in charts/sdk-java/values.yaml:  trivyThresholds:    defaultMaxScore: 5.0    overrides:      inventory-service: 4.5      orders-service: 5.5- Pipeline reads thresholds via readYaml and withCredentials- Enables service-specific gating policiesSlide 10: Live Demo Walkthrough- Execute feature/sdk-v1.4 branch pipeline- Observe parallel CVSS lookups completing in ~6s- Confirm threshold override for inventory-service (blocks only >4.5)- Show violation logging and pipeline halt messagesSlide 11: Performance Benchmark ResultsImage: Bar chart comparing sequential vs parallel lookup durations- Sequential execution: ~30s for 15 CVEs- Parallel (4 threads): ~6s for 15 CVEs- Cache hits: <50ms per repeated CVE lookupSlide 12: Next Steps- Merge pipeline-shared@1.3.2 with backoff enhancements- Era to finalize chart overrides PR by COB today- Schedule validation meeting via Teams for July 28- Extend integration to additional SDK pipelinesSlide 13: Q&A & Closing Remarks- Open the floor for feedback- Discuss optimal threshold values for Q4 roadmap- Plan phased rollout and runbook

By integrating real-time telemetry and a threshold-driven controller, we ensure that cache capacity adapts automatically to workload fluctuations, maintaining sub-3 ms p95 jwt_validation_latency and preventing backpressure in the streaming pipeline.Design and Implementation:At service startup, the LRU cache preloads active public keys, eliminating synchronous disk I/O on misses. The resize controller monitors the miss-rate metric (jwt_cache_miss_rate) over a sliding window (stabilityWindow) and triggers capacity increases of maxGrow entries when the miss rate exceeds missThreshold. Each resize action is subject to a cooldown (cooldownMs) to prevent oscillations. Metrics are emitted via Micrometer and collected by Prometheus, with recording rules tagged by phase (unit-test, smoke-test, canary) and environment (staging).Configuration Parameters:The dynamic_cache_settings.yaml file defines key parameters: maxCap: 512 (upper bound), maxGrow: 75 (entries per resize), stabilityWindow: 3m (miss-rate evaluation window), cooldownMs: 600000 (10-minute interval between resizes), and missThreshold: 0.01 (1% miss rate trigger). These defaults have been validated in staging canary runs at 8k msg/sec, showing two resize events with stable latencies and zero OOM events.Next Steps:We recommend integrating the dynamic resizing health check into the incident runbook and adding a Prometheus alert (CacheResizeMissThresholdBreached) to flag sustained miss-rate breaches. Additionally, updating the CI pipeline templates to parameterize missThreshold values will enable us to test boundary scenarios automatically. Production rollout is scheduled for 2025-07-30, with final verification via Grafana dashboards featuring interactive phase and environment filters.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-26T09:00:00Z"},{"type":"User","Address":{"City":"Elk Grove","Country":"USA","PostalCode":"95758","State":"CA","Street":"123 LiveOak Way"},"CompanyName":"LiveOak Digital","Department":"Engineering","DisplayName":"Shakia Gencarelli","FirstName":"Shakia","JobTitle":"Senior Software Engineer","LastName":"Gencarelli","MailNickName":"lod_shakiag","Manager":"lod_nilatanguma","OfficeLocation":"Elk Grove, CA","UsageLocation":"US","PhoneNumber":"+1 916 555 2749","Licenses":["Microsoft 365 Copilot","Microsoft Teams Enterprise","Office 365 E5 (no Teams)"]}]}

The adoption of Netty’s PooledByteBufAllocator has reduced garbage collection overhead by minimizing buffer churn, resulting in a 21.5% drop in 95th percentile latency under a 200-thread load. This analysis explores the allocation strategies that underpin this optimization, including direct versus heap buffer decisions, arena sizing, and thread-local caching. We also examine the refactored service discovery client in customer-service, where DNS lookups are cached for 60 seconds and metadata refresh logic has been extracted into a shared utility class. The combined effect of these changes has stabilized heap usage at 180 MB from a previous baseline of 210 MB, as evidenced by performance metrics captured with our JMeter test suite.In addition to memory pooling, the document delves into the enhancements to our consumer-driven contract testing workflow. We outline the process of adding a new fixture for the /transactions/status response to cover the settlementDate field, the configuration of a dedicated \"ContractTest\" stage in Jenkins, and the parallelization of four consumer verifiers to cut test runtimes from three minutes to two. Details of the Jenkinsfile syntax, including environment variable injection and stage dependencies, are provided to facilitate adoption by other service teams. The integration with the Pact Broker, combined with local dockerized verification, ensures that backward compatibility checks are automated and consistently enforced across our microservices.Finally, we present a roadmap for propagating these best practices throughout the organization. Recommendations include extending the pooled buffer approach to payments-service and new backend APIs, establishing a central Java utilities repository to host ByteBuffer management classes, and codifying our contract test conventions in the internal Engineering Style Guide. By formalizing these patterns, we aim to empower release managers and developers to maintain high performance and reliability standards as our platform continues to evolve.","TimeStamp":"2025-07-23T13:00:00Z"},{"type":"File","CreatedDate":"2025-07-02T10:00:00Z","FileId":"0005277a-0648-410d-a94c-42924759fafd","FileLocation":"files\\UserProfile_Workshop_Detailed_Outcomes.pptx","FileName":"UserProfile_Workshop_Detailed_Outcomes.pptx","LastModifiedDate":"2025-07-02T10:00:00Z","Owner":"lod_missbj","SharedWith":[{"Email":"lod_tonycool","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_terinahafen","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_saulq","PermissionLevel":"view"},{"Email":"lod_jackschrott","PermissionLevel":"edit"}],"FileDestination":"Presentations/Workshops","DestinationType":"site","Content":"Slide 1: Title & OverviewTitle: User Profile & Notification Pipelines Workshop – Detailed OutcomesPresenter: Miss Bjorkman | Date: 2025-07-02Slide 2: Agenda1.

Leveraging Vector v0.23.1 and Fluent Bit v2.0 as representative platforms, we instrument an in-cluster telemetry sidecar and evaluate p95 tail latency, memory footprint, and GC pause characteristics. Our experiments demonstrate that enabling dynamicBatchSizing with a memoryThresholdMb of 150 reduces peak heap usage by up to 12% with less than a 1.5% increase in p95 latency. We contextualize our findings against prior work on batching in streaming systems [1], adaptive rate control [2], and memory-driven telemetry shaping [3].1 INTRODUCTIONIn modern cloud-native architectures, service telemetry generation scales with application load. Traditional fixed-size batching can underuse available memory or exacerbate tail latency [1]. Dynamic batch sizing dynamically adjusts batch sizes in response to runtime memory pressure, aiming to optimize both throughput and resource utilization. We focus on real-time log routing within Kubernetes, where Vector and Fluent Bit are widely adopted (LiveOak evaluation session, 2025-07-23) [5].2 RELATED WORKThe concept of adaptive batching has roots in network packet scheduling [1] and stream processing engines like Apache Flink [4]. Brown et al. [1] showed that batch size adaptation reduces end-to-end latency variance. Chen and Kumar [2] proposed a memory-aware backpressure mechanism which we extend by tying batch size directly to heap thresholds. Tanguma et al. [3] introduced telemetry shaping based on garbage collector signals.3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUPWe deploy a test cluster in the dev namespace mirroring payments-api and auth-service workloads. Vector v0.23.1 and Fluent Bit v2.0 sidecars ingest logs with identical exporter gRPC endpoints. Baseline batchSize is 1024, fallbackBatchSize is 512, memoryThresholdMb is 150 as defined in values-logrouting.yaml [6]. We record p95 tail latency via Prometheus histogram_quantile(0.95) over 1m sliding windows and capture heap usage from JMX exporter metrics. Raw data appears in Appendix A and in the LogRoutingComparisonMatrix.pdf [5].4 RESULTSFigure 1 shows Vector cold-cache p95 latency at 102.0 ms vs. 101.4 ms with dynamic sizing enabled; warm-cache latencies of 95 ms remain stable. Heap usage peaks at 163 MB under static sizing, dropping to 144 MB when dynamicBatchSizing fires (trigger at 150 MB). GC pause p95 improves from 12 ms to 9 ms. Fluent Bit exhibits similar trends but with a higher memory footprint (~170 MB static, ~155 MB dynamic).5 DISCUSSIONOur results confirm that dynamic batch sizing yields significant memory savings without materially affecting latency, aligning with Brown et al. [1] and extending the adaptive backpressure model of Chen and Kumar [2]. The memoryThresholdMb of 150 MB offers a balance point: lower thresholds increase batch resizing frequency and overhead, while higher thresholds diminish memory savings. We observe a 12% reduction in static heap peaks and a 25% reduction in GC stall time.6 CONCLUSIONDynamic batch sizing is a practical enhancement for log routing in Kubernetes sidecars. With minimal configuration changes—a single memoryThresholdMb parameter—operators achieve lower memory footprints and smoother GC behavior while preserving p95 tail latency. Future work will explore feedback loops based on end-user latency SLAs and integration with distributed tracing contexts.REFERENCES[1] A. Brown, L. Wang, and J.
